<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">At its core,
ostree operates on an existing mounted filesystem. Tooling
such as ostree admin deploy will create a new directory that
can be used as a bootable target. This tool is designed to
run in an initramfs and set up &quot;remapping&quot; mounts
as a view into that filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As of more
recently, this tool also has optional support for composefs,
which creates a distinct mount point layered on top of the
underlying filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The most common
pattern today is to use systemd in an initramfs. The systemd
unit shipped upstream is ordered in this way:
After=sysroot.mount and Before=initrd-root-fs.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When it runs,
the mounted filesystem at the provided TARGET (usually
/sysroot) will be changed such that what appears at /sysroot
is actually the &quot;deployment root&quot; - i.e. a
particular versioned subdirectory. What was formerly the
&quot;physical root&quot; i.e. the real root of the
filesystem will appear as /sysroot/sysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For /var, by
default a bind mount is created from the deployment root to
/sysroot/var.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A read-only bind
mount is created over /sysroot/usr. The immutable bit (see
chattr(1)) is set on the deployment root, so this provides
basic protection for filesystem mutation. If the
sysroot.readonly option is enabled, then /sysroot/sysroot is
mounted read-only to provide further protection and a
writable bind mount for /sysroot/etc is created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, when
higher level tooling such as systemd performs a switch-root
operation, what was /sysroot becomes / and after the
transition into the real root, the system will be booted
into the &quot;deployment&quot;, which is a versioned
immutable filesystem tree. The ostree tooling running in the
real root thereafter performs further changes by operating
on /sysroot which is now the &quot;physical root&quot;.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
/usr/lib/ostree/prepare-root.conf (or
/etc/ostree/prepare-root.conf) config file is parsed by
ostree-prepare-root. This file must be present in the
initramfs. The default dracut module will copy it from the
real root if present.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sysroot.readonly</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">A boolean value; the default is
false unless composefs is enabled. If this is set to true,
then the /sysroot mount point is mounted read-only.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>etc.transient</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">A boolean value; the default is
false. If this is set to true, then the /etc mount point is
mounted transiently i.e. a non-persistent location.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>root.transient</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">A boolean value; the default is
false. Setting this flag to true requires composefs (See
composefs.enabled). When enabled, the root mount point /
will be an overlayfs whose contents will be stored in a
tmpfs, and hence discarded on OS upgrade or reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
independent of etc.transient and sysroot.readonly; it is
supported for example to have root.transient=true but
etc.transient=false in which case changes to /etc continue
to persist across updates, with the default OSTree 3-way
merge applied. Also related to persistence it is important
to emphasize that /sysroot (the physical root filesystem) is
still persistent by default; in-place OS upgrades can be
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Enabling this
option can make it significantly easier to adopt an
image-based model in some circumstances. For example, if you
have a configuration management system that is inspecting
machine-specific state and e.g. dynamically installing
packages or applying configuration, it can more easily be
adapted to run on each boot, while still shifting a portion
(or ideally most) image configuration to build time as part
of the base image/commit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>composefs.enabled</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This can be yes, no, maybe,
signed, or verity. The default is no. If set to yes, signed,
or verity, then composefs is always used, and the boot fails
if it is not available. If set to signed or verity, before
the content of a file is read, the integrity of its backing
OSTree object is validated by the digest stored in the
image. Additionally, if set to signed, boot will fail if the
image cannot be validated by a public key. Setting this to
maybe will cause composefs to be used at runtime only if the
deployment has a composefs generated, which causes
unpredicable and confusing semantics and is not recommended.
In practice with the <i>current</i> version of ostree, in
the case where composefs is enabled at build time for both
the version that made the deployment (often an older OS
version), this will be equivalent to yes. But in general one
either wants composefs or not, so choose an explicit value
for that.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>composefs.keypath</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Path to a file with Ed25519
public keys in the initramfs, used if composefs.enabled is
set to signed. The default value for this is
/etc/ostree/initramfs-root-binding.key. For a valid signed
boot the target OSTree commit must be signed by at least one
public key in this file, and the commitfs digest listed in
the commit must match the target composefs image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following
kernel commandline parameters are also parsed:</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ostree.prepare-root.composefs</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This accepts the same values as
composefs.enabled above, and overrides the config file (if
present). For example, specifying
ostree.prepare-root.composefs=0 will disable composefs, even
if it is enabled by default in the initrd config.</p>

<h2>SYSTEMD
<a name="SYSTEMD"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned
above, this tool comes with a systemd unit file
ostree-prepare-root.service and it is primarily expected to
be invoked this way.</p>

<h2>COMPOSEFS
<a name="COMPOSEFS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The default for
ostree is to create a plain hardlinked filesystem tree.
composefs support is currently experimental; see the
upstream doc/composefs.md for more information on using
it.</p>
