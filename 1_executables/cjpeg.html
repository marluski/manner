<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">cjpeg - compress
an image file to a JPEG file</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cjpeg</b> [
<i>options</i> ] [ <i>filename</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cjpeg</b>
compresses the named image file, or the standard input if no
file is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the standard
output. The currently supported input file formats are: PPM
(PBMPLUS color format), PGM (PBMPLUS grayscale format), BMP,
GIF [legacy feature], and Targa [legacy feature].</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All switch names
may be abbreviated; for example, <b>-grayscale</b> may be
written <b>-gray</b> or <b>-gr</b>. Most of the
&quot;basic&quot; switches can be abbreviated to as little
as one letter. Upper and lower case are equivalent (thus
<b>-BMP</b> is the same as <b>-bmp</b>). British spellings
are also accepted (e.g. <b>-greyscale</b>), though for
brevity these are not mentioned below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
switches are: <b><br>
-quality</b> <i>N[,...]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scale quantization tables to
adjust image quality. Quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best);
default is 75. (See below for more info.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-grayscale</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Create monochrome JPEG file
from color input. By specifying <b>-grayscale,</b>
you&rsquo;ll get a smaller JPEG file that takes less time to
process.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="5%">


<p><b>-rgb</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Create RGB JPEG file. Using this switch suppresses the
conversion from RGB colorspace input to the default YCbCr
JPEG colorspace.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-optimize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Perform optimization of entropy
encoding parameters. Without this, default encoding
parameters are used. <b>-optimize</b> usually makes the JPEG
file a little smaller, but <b>cjpeg</b> runs somewhat slower
and needs much more memory. Image quality and speed of
decompression are unaffected by <b>-optimize</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-progressive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Create progressive JPEG file
(see below). Implies <b>-optimize</b> unless
<b>-arithmetic</b> is also specified.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>-targa</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Input file is Targa format [legacy feature]. Targa files
that contain an &quot;identification&quot; field will not be
automatically recognized by <b>cjpeg</b>. For such files,
you must specify <b>-targa</b> to make <b>cjpeg</b> treat
the input as Targa format. For most Targa files, you
won&rsquo;t need this switch.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-quality</b> switch lets you trade off compressed file
size against quality of the reconstructed image: the higher
the quality setting, the larger the JPEG file, and the
closer the output image will be to the original input.
Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting
(smallest file) that decompresses into something visually
indistinguishable from the original image. For this purpose
the quality setting should generally be between 50 and 95
(the default is 75) for photographic images. If you see
defects at <b>-quality</b> 75, then go up 5 or 10 counts at
a time until you are happy with the output image. (The
optimal setting will vary from one image to another.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-quality</b>
100 will generate a quantization table of all 1&rsquo;s,
minimizing loss in the quantization step (but there is still
information loss in subsampling, as well as roundoff error.)
For most images, specifying a quality value above about 95
will increase the size of the compressed file dramatically,
and while the quality gain from these higher quality values
is measurable (using metrics such as PSNR or SSIM), it is
rarely perceivable by human vision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the other
direction, quality values below 50 will produce very small
files of low image quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be
useful in preparing an index of a large image library, for
example. Try <b>-quality</b> 2 (or so) for some amusing
Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25
generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are considered
optional in the JPEG standard. <b>cjpeg</b> emits a warning
message when you give such a quality value, because some
other JPEG programs may be unable to decode the resulting
file. Use <b>-baseline</b> if you need to ensure
compatibility at low quality values.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-quality</b> option has been extended in this version of
<b>cjpeg</b> to support separate quality settings for
luminance and chrominance (or, in general, separate settings
for every quantization table slot.) The principle is the
same as chrominance subsampling: since the human eye is more
sensitive to spatial changes in brightness than spatial
changes in color, the chrominance components can be
quantized more than the luminance components without
incurring any visible image quality loss. However, unlike
subsampling, this feature reduces data in the frequency
domain instead of the spatial domain, which allows for more
fine-grained control. This option is useful in
quality-sensitive applications, for which the artifacts
generated by subsampling may be unacceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-quality</b> option accepts a comma-separated list of
parameters, which respectively refer to the quality levels
that should be assigned to the quantization table slots. If
there are more q-table slots than parameters, then the last
parameter is replicated. Thus, if only one quality parameter
is given, this is used for both luminance and chrominance
(slots 0 and 1, respectively), preserving the legacy
behavior of cjpeg v6b and prior. More (or customized)
quantization tables can be set with the <b>-qtables</b>
option and assigned to components with the <b>-qslots</b>
option (see the &quot;wizard&quot; switches below.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">JPEG files
generated with separate luminance and chrominance quality
are fully compliant with standard JPEG decoders.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CAUTION:</b>
For this setting to be useful, be sure to pass an argument
of <b>-sample 1x1</b> to <b>cjpeg</b> to disable chrominance
subsampling. Otherwise, the default subsampling level (2x2,
AKA &quot;4:2:0&quot;) will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-progressive</b> switch creates a &quot;progressive
JPEG&quot; file. In this type of JPEG file, the data is
stored in multiple scans of increasing quality. If the file
is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the
decoder can use the first scan to display a low-quality
image very quickly, and can then improve the display with
each subsequent scan. The final image is exactly equivalent
to a standard JPEG file of the same quality setting, and the
total file size is about the same --- often a little
smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Switches for
advanced users: <b><br>
-precision</b> <i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Create JPEG file with N-bit
data precision. N is 2 to 16; default is 8. If N is not 8 or
12, then <b>-lossless</b> must also be specified. Note that
only the PBMPLUS input file format supports data precisions
other than 8. Note also that PBMPLUS input files are
silently scaled to the target data precision, even if it is
lower than the precision of the input file. Passing an
argument of <b>-verbose</b> to <b>cjpeg</b> will cause it to
print information about the precision of the input file.
<b>Caution:</b> only 8-bit data precision is widely
implemented, so many decoders will be unable to handle JPEG
files with other data precisions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-precision&nbsp;12</b>
implies <b>-optimize</b> unless <b>-arithmetic</b> is also
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-lossless</b>
<i>psv[,Pt]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Create a lossless JPEG file
using the specified predictor selection value (1 through 7)
and optional point transform (0 through <i>precision</i> -
1, where <i>precision</i> is the JPEG data precision in
bits). A point transform value of 0 (the default) is
necessary in order to create a fully lossless JPEG file. (A
non-zero point transform value right-shifts the input
samples by the specified number of bits, which is
effectively a form of lossy color quantization.)
<b>Caution:</b> lossless JPEG is not yet widely implemented,
so many decoders will be unable to handle a lossless JPEG
file at all. In most cases, compressing and decompressing a
lossless JPEG file is considerably slower than compressing
and decompressing a lossy JPEG file, and lossless JPEG files
are much larger than lossy JPEG files. Also note that the
following features will be unavailable when compressing or
decompressing a lossless JPEG file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">-
Quality/quantization table selection</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">- Color space
conversion (the JPEG image will use the same color space as
the input image)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">- Color
quantization</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">- DCT/IDCT
algorithm selection</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">- Smoothing</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">-
Downsampling/upsampling</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">- IDCT
scaling</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">- Partial image
decompression</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">-
Transformations using <b>jpegtran</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Any switches
used to enable or configure those features will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-arithmetic</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use arithmetic coding.
<b>Caution:</b> arithmetic-coded JPEG is not yet widely
implemented, so many decoders will be unable to handle an
arithmetic-coded JPEG file at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-dct int</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use accurate integer DCT method
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-dct fast</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use less accurate integer DCT
method [legacy feature]. When the Independent JPEG
Group&rsquo;s software was first released in 1991, the
compression time for a 1-megapixel JPEG image on a
mainstream PC was measured in minutes. Thus, the <b>fast</b>
integer DCT algorithm provided noticeable performance
benefits. On modern CPUs running libjpeg-turbo, however, the
compression time for a 1-megapixel JPEG image is measured in
milliseconds, and thus the performance benefits of the
<b>fast</b> algorithm are much less noticeable. On modern
x86/x86-64 CPUs that support AVX2 instructions, the
<b>fast</b> and <b>int</b> methods have similar performance.
On other types of CPUs, the <b>fast</b> method is generally
about 5-15% faster than the <b>int</b> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For quality
levels of 90 and below, there should be little or no
perceptible quality difference between the two algorithms.
For quality levels above 90, however, the difference between
the <b>fast</b> and <b>int</b> methods becomes more
pronounced. With quality=97, for instance, the <b>fast</b>
method incurs generally about a 1-3 dB loss in PSNR relative
to the <b>int</b> method, but this can be larger for some
images. Do not use the <b>fast</b> method with quality
levels above 97. The algorithm often degenerates at
quality=98 and above and can actually produce a more lossy
image than if lower quality levels had been used. Also, in
libjpeg-turbo, the <b>fast</b> method is not fully
accelerated for quality levels above 97, so it will be
slower than the <b>int</b> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-dct float</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use floating-point DCT method
[legacy feature]. The <b>float</b> method does not produce
significantly more accurate results than the <b>int</b>
method, and it is much slower. The <b>float</b> method may
also give different results on different machines due to
varying roundoff behavior, whereas the integer methods
should give the same results on all machines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-icc</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Embed ICC color management
profile contained in the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-restart</b> <i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Emit a JPEG restart marker
every N MCU rows, or every N MCUs if &quot;B&quot; is
attached to the number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In typical JPEG
images, an MCU (Minimum Coded Unit) is the minimum set of
interleaved &quot;data units&quot; (8x8 DCT blocks if the
image is lossy or samples if the image is lossless)
necessary to represent at least one data unit per component.
(For example, an MCU in an interleaved lossy JPEG image that
uses 4:2:2 subsampling consists of two luminance blocks
followed by one block for each chrominance component.) In
single-component or non-interleaved JPEG images, an MCU is
the same as a data unit. An MCU row is a row of MCUs
spanning the entire width of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-restart
0</b> (the default) means no restart markers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-smooth</b> <i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Smooth the input image to
eliminate dithering noise. N, ranging from 1 to 100,
indicates the strength of smoothing. 0 (the default) means
no smoothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-maxmemory</b> <i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set limit for amount of memory
to use in processing large images. Value is in thousands of
bytes, or millions of bytes if &quot;M&quot; is attached to
the number. For example, <b>-max 4m</b> selects 4000000
bytes. If more space is needed, an error will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-outfile</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Send output image to the named
file, not to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-memdst</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Compress to memory instead of a
file. This feature was implemented mainly as a way of
testing the in-memory destination manager (jpeg_mem_dest()),
but it is also useful for benchmarking, since it reduces the
I/O overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-report</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Report compression
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-strict</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Treat all warnings as fatal.
Enabling this option will cause the compressor to abort if
an LZW-compressed GIF input image contains incomplete or
corrupt image data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enable debug printout. More
<b>-v</b>&rsquo;s give more output. Also, version
information is printed at startup.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>-debug</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="22%">


<p>Same as <b>-verbose</b>.</p></td>
<td width="60%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-restart</b> option inserts extra markers that allow a
JPEG decoder to resynchronize after a transmission error.
Without restart markers, any damage to a compressed file
will usually ruin the image from the point of the error to
the end of the image; with restart markers, the damage is
usually confined to the portion of the image up to the next
restart marker. Of course, the restart markers occupy extra
space. We recommend <b>-restart 1</b> for images that will
be transmitted across unreliable networks such as
Usenet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-smooth</b> option filters the input to eliminate
fine-scale noise. This is often useful when converting
dithered images to JPEG: a moderate smoothing factor of 10
to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file,
resulting in a smaller JPEG file and a better-looking image.
Too large a smoothing factor will visibly blur the image,
however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Switches for
wizards: <b><br>
-baseline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Force baseline-compatible
quantization tables to be generated. This clamps
quantization values to 8 bits even at low quality settings.
(This switch is poorly named, since it does not ensure that
the output is actually baseline JPEG. For example, you can
use <b>-baseline</b> and <b>-progressive</b> together.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-qtables</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the quantization tables
given in the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-qslots</b>
<i>N[,...]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select which quantization table
to use for each color component.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-sample</b>
<i>HxV[,...]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set JPEG sampling factors for
each color component.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>-scans</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the scan script given in
the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;wizard&quot; switches are intended for experimentation
with JPEG. If you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing,
<b>don&rsquo;t use them</b>. These switches are documented
further in the file wizard.txt.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This example
compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality factor of 60
and saves the output as foo.jpg:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cjpeg
-quality</b> <i>60 foo.ppm</i> <b>&gt;</b>
<i>foo.jpg</i></p>

<h2>HINTS
<a name="HINTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Color GIF files
are not the ideal input for JPEG; JPEG is really intended
for compressing full-color (24-bit through 48-bit) images.
In particular, don&rsquo;t try to convert cartoons, line
drawings, and other images that have only a few distinct
colors. GIF works great on these; JPEG does not. If you want
to convert a GIF to JPEG, you should experiment with
<b>cjpeg</b>&rsquo;s <b>-quality</b> and <b>-smooth</b>
options to get a satisfactory conversion. <b>-smooth 10</b>
or so is often helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Avoid running an
image through a series of JPEG compression/decompression
cycles. Image quality loss will accumulate; after ten or so
cycles the image may be noticeably worse than it was after
one cycle. It&rsquo;s best to use a lossless format while
manipulating an image, then convert to JPEG format when you
are ready to file the image away.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-optimize</b> option to <b>cjpeg</b> is worth using when
you are making a &quot;final&quot; version for posting or
archiving. It&rsquo;s also a win when you are using low
quality settings to make very small JPEG files; the
percentage improvement is often a lot more than it is on
larger files. (At present, <b>-optimize</b> mode is always
selected when generating progressive JPEG files.)</p>
