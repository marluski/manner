<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">git-credential -
Retrieve and store user credentials</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">'git credential'
(fill|approve|reject|capability)</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Git has an
internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials
from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user
for usernames and passwords. The git-credential command
exposes this interface to scripts which may want to
retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in the same
manner as Git. The design of this scriptable interface
models the internal C API; see credential.h for more
background on the concepts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">git-credential
takes an &quot;action&quot; option on the command-line (one
of <b>fill</b>, <b>approve</b>, or <b>reject</b>) and reads
a credential description on stdin (see INPUT/OUTPUT
FORMAT).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the action is
<b>fill</b>, git-credential will attempt to add
&quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot; attributes to
the description by reading config files, by contacting any
configured credential helpers, or by prompting the user. The
username and password attributes of the credential
description are then printed to stdout together with the
attributes already provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the action is
<b>approve</b>, git-credential will send the description to
any configured credential helpers, which may store the
credential for later use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the action is
<b>reject</b>, git-credential will send the description to
any configured credential helpers, which may erase any
stored credentials matching the description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the action is
<b>capability</b>, git-credential will announce any
capabilities it supports to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the action is
<b>approve</b> or <b>reject</b>, no output should be
emitted.</p>

<h2>TYPICAL USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL
<a name="TYPICAL USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An application
using git-credential will typically use <b>git
credential</b> following these steps:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">1. Generate a
credential description based on the context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
we want a password for <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b>,
we might generate the following credential description
(don&rsquo;t forget the blank line at the end; it tells
<b>git credential</b> that the application finished feeding
all the information it has):</p>

<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">protocol=https
<br>
host=example.com <br>
path=foo.git</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">2. Ask
git-credential to give us a username and password for this
description. This is done by running <b>git credential
fill</b>, feeding the description from step (1) to its
standard input. The complete credential description
(including the credential per se, i.e. the login and
password) will be produced on standard output, like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">protocol=https
<br>
host=example.com <br>
username=bob <br>
password=secr3t</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
this means the attributes given in the input will be
repeated in the output, but Git may also modify the
credential description, for example by removing the
<b>path</b> attribute when the protocol is HTTP(s) and
<b>credential.useHttpPath</b> is false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If the <b>git
credential</b> knew about the password, this step may not
have involved the user actually typing this password (the
user may have typed a password to unlock the keychain
instead, or no user interaction was done if the keychain was
already unlocked) before it returned
<b>password=secr3t</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">3. Use the
credential (e.g., access the URL with the username and
password from step (2)), and see if it&rsquo;s accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">4. Report on
the success or failure of the password. If the credential
allowed the operation to complete successfully, then it can
be marked with an &quot;approve&quot; action to tell <b>git
credential</b> to reuse it in its next invocation. If the
credential was rejected during the operation, use the
&quot;reject&quot; action so that <b>git credential</b> will
ask for a new password in its next invocation. In either
case, <b>git credential</b> should be fed with the
credential description obtained from step (2) (which also
contains the fields provided in step (1)).</p>

<h2>INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT
<a name="INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
credential</b> reads and/or writes (depending on the action
used) credential information in its standard input/output.
This information can correspond either to keys for which
<b>git credential</b> will obtain the login information
(e.g. host, protocol, path), or to the actual credential
data to be obtained (username/password).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The credential
is split into a set of named attributes, with one attribute
per line. Each attribute is specified by a key-value pair,
separated by an <b>=</b> (equals) sign, followed by a
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The key may
contain any bytes except <b>=</b>, newline, or NUL. The
value may contain any bytes except newline or NUL. A line,
including the trailing newline, may not exceed 65535 bytes
in order to allow implementations to parse efficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Attributes with
keys that end with C-style array brackets [] can have
multiple values. Each instance of a multi-valued attribute
forms an ordered list of values - the order of the repeated
attributes defines the order of the values. An empty
multi-valued attribute (<b>key</b>[]<b>=</b>\n) acts to
clear any previous entries and reset the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In all cases,
all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there is no quoting, and
one cannot transmit a value with newline or NUL in it). The
list of attributes is terminated by a blank line or
end-of-file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Git understands
the following attributes:</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>protocol</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The protocol over which the
credential will be used (e.g., <b>https</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>host</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The remote hostname for a
network credential. This includes the port number if one was
specified (e.g., &quot;example.com:8088&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>path</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The path with which the
credential will be used. E.g., for accessing a remote https
repository, this will be the repository&rsquo;s path on the
server.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>username</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The credential&rsquo;s
username, if we already have one (e.g., from a URL, the
configuration, the user, or from a previously run
helper).</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The credential&rsquo;s
password, if we are asking it to be stored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>password_expiry_utc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Generated passwords such as an
OAuth access token may have an expiry date. When reading
credentials from helpers, <b>git credential fill</b> ignores
expired passwords. Represented as Unix time UTC, seconds
since 1970.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>oauth_refresh_token</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">An OAuth refresh token may
accompany a password that is an OAuth access token. Helpers
must treat this attribute as confidential like the password
attribute. Git itself has no special behaviour for this
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>url</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">When this special attribute is
read by <b>git credential</b>, the value is parsed as a URL
and treated as if its constituent parts were read (e.g.,
<b>url=https://example.com</b> would behave as if
<b>protocol=https</b> and <b>host=example.com</b> had been
provided). This can help callers avoid parsing URLs
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
specifying a protocol is mandatory and if the URL
doesn&rsquo;t specify a hostname (e.g.,
&quot;cert:///path/to/file&quot;) the credential will
contain a hostname attribute whose value is an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Components
which are missing from the URL (e.g., there is no username
in the example above) will be left unset.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>authtype</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This indicates that the
authentication scheme in question should be used. Common
values for HTTP and HTTPS include <b>basic</b>,
<b>bearer</b>, and <b>digest</b>, although the latter is
insecure and should not be used. If <b>credential</b> is
used, this may be set to an arbitrary string suitable for
the protocol in question (usually HTTP).</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This value
should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see
below) is provided on input.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>credential</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The pre-encoded credential,
suitable for the protocol in question (usually HTTP). If
this key is sent, <b>authtype</b> is mandatory, and
<b>username</b> and <b>password</b> are not used. For HTTP,
Git concatenates the <b>authtype</b> value and this value
with a single space to determine the <b>Authorization</b>
header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This value
should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see
below) is provided on input.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ephemeral</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This boolean value indicates,
if true, that the value in the <b>credential</b> field
should not be saved by the credential helper because its
usefulness is limited in time. For example, an HTTP Digest
<b>credential</b> value is computed using a nonce and
reusing it will not result in successful authentication.
This may also be used for situations with short duration
(e.g., 24-hour) credentials. The default value is false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The credential
helper will still be invoked with <b>store</b> or
<b>erase</b> so that it can determine whether the operation
was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This value
should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see
below) is provided on input.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>state</b>[]</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This value provides an opaque
state that will be passed back to this helper if it is
called again. Each different credential helper may specify
this once. The value should include a prefix unique to the
credential helper and should ignore values that don&rsquo;t
match its prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This value
should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see
below) is provided on input.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>continue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is a boolean value, which,
if enabled, indicates that this authentication is a
non-final part of a multistage authentication step. This is
common in protocols such as NTLM and Kerberos, where two
rounds of client authentication are required, and setting
this flag allows the credential helper to implement the
multistage authentication step. This flag should only be
sent if a further stage is required; that is, if another
round of authentication is expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This value
should not be sent unless the appropriate capability (see
below) is provided on input. This attribute is
<i>one-way</i> from a credential helper to pass information
to Git (or other programs invoking <b>git
credential</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wwwauth</b>[]</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">When an HTTP response is
received by Git that includes one or more
<i>WWW-Authenticate</i> authentication headers, these will
be passed by Git to credential helpers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Each
<i>WWW-Authenticate</i> header value is passed as a
multi-valued attribute <i>wwwauth[]</i>, where the order of
the attributes is the same as they appear in the HTTP
response. This attribute is <i>one-way</i> from Git to pass
additional information to credential helpers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>capability</b>[]</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This signals that Git, or the
helper, as appropriate, supports the capability in question.
This can be used to provide better, more specific data as
part of the protocol. A <b>capability</b>[] directive must
precede any value depending on it and these directives
<i>should</i> be the first item announced in the
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
currently supported capabilities. The first is
<b>authtype</b>, which indicates that the <b>authtype</b>,
<b>credential</b>, and <b>ephemeral</b> values are
understood. The second is <b>state</b>, which indicates that
the <b>state</b>[] and <b>continue</b> values are
understood.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
obligatory to use the additional features just because the
capability is supported, but they should not be provided
without the capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Unrecognised
attributes and capabilities are silently discarded.</p>

<h2>CAPABILITY INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT
<a name="CAPABILITY INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For <b>git
credential capability</b>, the format is slightly different.
First, a <b>version 0</b> announcement is made to indicate
the current version of the protocol, and then each
capability is announced with a line like <b>capability
authtype</b>. Credential helpers may also implement this
format, again with the <b>capability</b> argument.
Additional lines may be added in the future; callers should
ignore lines which they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Because this is
a new part of the credential helper protocol, older versions
of Git, as well as some credential helpers, may not support
it. If a non-zero exit status is received, or if the first
line doesn&rsquo;t start with the word <b>version</b> and a
space, callers should assume that no capabilities are
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The intention of
this format is to differentiate it from the credential
output in an unambiguous way. It is possible to use very
simple credential helpers (e.g., inline shell scripts) which
always produce identical output. Using a distinct format
allows users to continue to use this syntax without having
to worry about correctly implementing capability
advertisements or accidentally confusing callers querying
for capabilities.</p>
