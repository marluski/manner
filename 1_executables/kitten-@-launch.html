<h2>Description

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Prints out the
id of the newly opened window. Any command line arguments
are assumed to be the command line used to run in the new
window, if none are provided, the default shell is run. For
example::</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">kitten @ launch
--title=Email mutt</p>

<h2>Options
<a name="Options"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--match,
-m</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The tab to match. Match
specifications are of the form: field:query. Where field can
be one of: id, index, title, window_id, window_title, pid,
cwd, cmdline env, var, state and recent. query is the
expression to match. Expressions can be either a number or a
regular expression, and can be combined using Boolean
operators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The special
value all matches all tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For numeric
fields: id, index, window_id, pid and recent, the expression
is interpreted as a number, not a regular expression.
Negative values for id/window_id match from the highest id
number down, in particular, -1 is the most recently created
tab/window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When using
title or id, first a matching tab is looked for, and if not
found a matching window is looked for, and the tab for that
window is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use window_id and window_title to match the tab that
contains the window with the specified id or title.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The index
number is used to match the nth tab in the currently active
OS window. The recent number matches recently active tabs in
the currently active OS window, with zero being the
currently active tab, one the previously active tab and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
env field to match on environment variables, you can specify
only the environment variable name or a name and value, for
example, env:MY_ENV_VAR=2. Tabs containing any window with
the specified environment variables are matched. Similarly,
var matches tabs containing any window with the specified
user variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The field state
matches on the state of the tab. Supported states are:
active, focused, needs_attention, parent_active and
parent_focused. Active tabs are the tabs that are active in
their parent OS window. There is only one focused tab and it
is the tab to which keyboard events are delivered. If no tab
is focused, the last focused tab is matched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can use the kitten @ ls command to get a list of tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--no-response</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Do not print out the id of the
newly created window.</p>

syntax used for specifying windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--title,
--window-title</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The title to set for the new

the <b>--source-window.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--tab-title</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The title for the new tab if
launching in a new tab. By default, the title of the active
window in the tab is used as the tab title. The special
value current will copy the title from the tab containing
the <b>--source-window.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--type</b>
<i>[=window]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Where to launch the child
process:</p>

window</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">overlay-main
<br>
An overlay window covering the current active kitty window.
Unlike a plain overlay window, this window is considered as
a main window which means it is used as the active window
for getting the current working directory, the input text
for kittens, launch commands, etc. Useful if this overlay is
intended to run for a long time as a primary window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">background <br>
The process will be run in the background, without a kitty
window. Note that if <b>--allow-remote-control is specified
the KITTY_LISTEN_ON environment variable will be set to a
dedicated socket pair file descriptor that the process can
use for remote control.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">clipboard,

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Copy the environment variables
from the <b>--source-window into the newly launched child
process. Note that this only copies the environment when the
window was first created, as it is not possible to get
updated environment variables from arbitrary processes. To
copy that environment, use either the clone-in-kitty feature
or the kitty remote control feature with --copy-env.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--location</b>
<i>[=default]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Where to place the newly
created window when it is added to a tab which already has
existing windows in it. after and before place the new
window before or after the active window. neighbor is a
synonym for after. Also applies to creating a new tab, where
the value of after will cause the new tab to be placed next
to the current tab instead of at the end. The values of
vsplit, hsplit and split are only used by the splits layout
and control if the new window is placed in a vertical,
horizontal or automatic split with the currently active
window. The default is to place the window in a layout
dependent manner, typically, after the currently active
window. See <b>--next-to to use a window other than the
currently active window.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Choices:
default, after, before, first, hsplit, last, neighbor,
split, vsplit</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--next-to</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A match expression to select
the window next to which the new window is created. See
search_syntax for the syntax for specifying windows. If not
specified defaults to the active window. When used via
remote control and a target tab is specified this option is
ignored unless the matched window is in the specified tab.
When using <b>--type of tab, the tab will be created in the
OS Window containing the matched window.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--bias</b> <i>[=0]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The bias used to alter the size
of the window. It controls what fraction of available space
the window takes. The exact meaning of bias depends on the
current layout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">* Splits
layout: The bias is interpreted as a percentage between 0
and 100. When splitting a window into two, the new window
will take up the specified fraction of the space alloted to
the original window and the original window will take up the
remainder of the space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">*
Vertical/horizontal layout: The bias is interpreted as
adding/subtracting from the normal size of the window. It
should be a number between -90 and 90. This number is the
percentage of the OS Window size that should be added to the
window size. So for example, if a window would normally have
been size 50 in the layout inside an OS Window that is size
80 high and --bias -10 is used it will become
*approximately* size 42 high. Note that sizes are
approximations, you cannot use this method to create windows
of fixed sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">* Tall layout:
If the window being created is the *first* window in a
column, then the bias is interpreted as a percentage, as for
the splits layout, splitting the OS Window width between
columns. If the window is a second or subsequent window in a
column the bias is interpreted as adding/subtracting from
the window size as for the vertical layout above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">* Fat layout:
Same as tall layout except it goes by rows instead of
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">* Grid layout:
The bias is interpreted the same way as for the Vertical and
Horizontal layouts, as something to be added/subtracted to
the normal size. However, the since in a grid layout there
are rows *and* columns, the bias on the first window in a
column operates on the columns. Any later windows in that
column operate on the row. So, for example, if you bias the
first window in a grid layout it will change the width of
the first column, the second window, the width of the second
column, the third window, the height of the second row and
so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The bias option
was introduced in kitty version 0.36.0.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--allow-remote-control</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Programs running in this window
can control kitty (even if remote control is not enabled in
<i>kitty.conf). Note that any program with the right level
of permissions can still write to the pipes of any other
program on the same computer and therefore can control
kitty. It can, however, be useful to block programs running
on other computers (for example, over SSH) or as other
users. See</i> <b>--remote-control-password for ways to
restrict actions allowed by remote control.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--remote-control-password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Restrict the actions remote
control is allowed to take. This works like
<b>remote_control_password. You can specify a password and
list of actions just as for remote_control_password. For
example::</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">--remote-control-password
'&quot;my passphrase&quot; get-* set-colors'</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This password
will be in effect for this window only. Note that any
passwords you have defined for <b>remote_control_password
in</b> <i>kitty.conf are also in effect. You can override
them by using the same password here. You can also disable
all</i> <b>remote_control_password global passwords for this
window, by using::</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">--remote-control-password
'!'</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This option
only takes effect if <b>--allow-remote-control is also
specified. Can be specified multiple times to create
multiple passwords. This option was added to kitty in
version 0.26.0</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--stdin-source</b>
<i>[=none]</i></p>

is the same as @screen, but includes the scrollback buffer
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">@alternate <br>
is the secondary screen of the <b>--source-window. For
example if you run a full screen terminal application, the
secondary screen will be the screen you return to when
quitting the application.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">@first_cmd_output_on_screen
<br>
is the output from the first command run in the shell on
screen.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">@last_cmd_output
<br>
is the output from the last command run in the shell.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">@last_visited_cmd_output
<br>
is the first output below the last scrolled position via
scroll_to_prompt, this needs shell integration to work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Choices: none,
@alternate, @alternate_scrollback,
@first_cmd_output_on_screen, @last_cmd_output,
@last_visited_cmd_output, @screen, @screen_scrollback,
@selection</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>--stdin-add-formatting</b></p>
