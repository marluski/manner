<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">git-rerere -
Reuse recorded resolution of conflicted merges</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
rerere</i> [clear | forget &lt;pathspec&gt;... | diff |
status | remaining | gc]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In a workflow
employing relatively long lived topic branches, the
developer sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over
and over again until the topic branches are done (either
merged to the &quot;release&quot; branch, or sent out and
accepted upstream).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This command
assists the developer in this process by recording
conflicted automerge results and corresponding hand resolve
results on the initial manual merge, and applying previously
recorded hand resolutions to their corresponding automerge
results.</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">You need to set
the configuration variable <b>rerere.enabled</b> in order to
enable this command.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, <i>git
rerere</i> is run without arguments or user-intervention.
However, it has several commands that allow it to interact
with its working state.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>clear</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Reset the metadata used by
rerere if a merge resolution is to be aborted. Calling
<i>git am [--skip|--abort]</i> or <i>git rebase
[--skip|--abort]</i> will automatically invoke this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>forget</i>
&lt;pathspec&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Reset the conflict resolutions
which rerere has recorded for the current conflict in
&lt;pathspec&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>diff</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Display diffs for the current
state of the resolution. It is useful for tracking what has
changed while the user is resolving conflicts. Additional
arguments are passed directly to the system <i>diff</i>
command installed in PATH.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>status</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Print paths with conflicts
whose merge resolution rerere will record.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>remaining</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Print paths with conflicts that
have not been autoresolved by rerere. This includes paths
whose resolutions cannot be tracked by rerere, such as
conflicting submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>gc</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Prune records of conflicted
merges that occurred a long time ago. By default, unresolved
conflicts older than 15 days and resolved conflicts older
than 60 days are pruned. These defaults are controlled via
the <b>gc.rerereUnresolved</b> and <b>gc.rerereResolved</b>
configuration variables respectively.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION
<a name="DISCUSSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When your topic
branch modifies an overlapping area that your master branch
(or upstream) touched since your topic branch forked from
it, you may want to test it with the latest master, even
before your topic branch is ready to be pushed upstream:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">o---*---o topic
<br>
/ <br>
o---o---o---*---o---o master</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For such a test,
you need to merge master and topic somehow. One way to do it
is to pull master into the topic branch:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">$ git switch
topic <br>
$ git merge master</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">o---*---o---+
topic <br>
/ / <br>
o---o---o---*---o---o master</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The commits
marked with * touch the same area in the same file; you need
to resolve the conflicts when creating the commit marked
with <b>+</b>. Then you can test the result to make sure
your work-in-progress still works with what is in the latest
master.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">After this test
merge, there are two ways to continue your work on the
topic. The easiest is to build on top of the test merge
commit <b>+</b>, and when your work in the topic branch is
finally ready, pull the topic branch into master, and/or ask
the upstream to pull from you. By that time, however, the
master or the upstream might have been advanced since the
test merge <b>+</b>, in which case the final commit graph
would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">$ git switch
topic <br>
$ git merge master <br>
$ ... work on both topic and master branches <br>
$ git switch master <br>
$ git merge topic</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">o---*---o---+---o---o
topic <br>
/ / \ <br>
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When your topic
branch is long-lived, however, your topic branch would end
up having many such &quot;Merge from master&quot; commits on
it, which would unnecessarily clutter the development
history. Readers of the Linux kernel mailing list may
remember that Linus complained about such too frequent test
merges when a subsystem maintainer asked to pull from a
branch full of &quot;useless merges&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As an
alternative, to keep the topic branch clean of test merges,
you could blow away the test merge, and keep building on top
of the tip before the test merge:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">$ git switch
topic <br>
$ git merge master <br>
$ git reset --hard HEAD&#710; ;# rewind the test merge <br>
$ ... work on both topic and master branches <br>
$ git switch master <br>
$ git merge topic</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">o---*---o-------o---o
topic <br>
/ \ <br>
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This would leave
only one merge commit when your topic branch is finally
ready and merged into the master branch. This merge would
require you to resolve the conflict, introduced by the
commits marked with *. However, this conflict is often the
same conflict you resolved when you created the test merge
you blew away. <i>git rerere</i> helps you resolve this
final conflicted merge using the information from your
earlier hand resolve.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Running the
<i>git rerere</i> command immediately after a conflicted
automerge records the conflicted working tree files, with
the usual conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,
<b>=======</b>, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in them.
Later, after you are done resolving the conflicts, running
<i>git rerere</i> again will record the resolved state of
these files. Suppose you did this when you created the test
merge of master into the topic branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Next time, after
seeing the same conflicted automerge, running <i>git
rerere</i> will perform a three-way merge between the
earlier conflicted automerge, the earlier manual resolution,
and the current conflicted automerge. If this three-way
merge resolves cleanly, the result is written out to your
working tree file, so you do not have to manually resolve
it. Note that <i>git rerere</i> leaves the index file alone,
so you still need to do the final sanity checks with <b>git
diff</b> (or <b>git diff -c</b>) and <i>git add</i> when you
are satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As a convenience
measure, <i>git merge</i> automatically invokes <i>git
rerere</i> upon exiting with a failed automerge and <i>git
rerere</i> records the hand resolve when it is a new
conflict, or reuses the earlier hand resolve when it is not.
<i>git commit</i> also invokes <i>git rerere</i> when
committing a merge result. What this means is that you do
not have to do anything special yourself (besides enabling
the rerere.enabled config variable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In our example,
when you do the test merge, the manual resolution is
recorded, and it will be reused when you do the actual merge
later with the updated master and topic branch, as long as
the recorded resolution is still applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The information
<i>git rerere</i> records is also used when running <i>git
rebase</i>. After blowing away the test merge and continuing
development on the topic branch:</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">o---*---o-------o---o
topic <br>
/ <br>
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o master</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">$ git rebase
master topic</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">o---*---o-------o---o
topic <br>
/ <br>
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o master</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">you could run
<b>git rebase master topic</b>, to bring yourself up to date
before your topic is ready to be sent upstream. This would
result in falling back to a three-way merge, and it would
conflict the same way as the test merge you resolved
earlier. <i>git rerere</i> will be run by <i>git rebase</i>
to help you resolve this conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">[NOTE] <i>git
rerere</i> relies on the conflict markers in the file to
detect the conflict. If the file already contains lines that
look the same as lines with conflict markers, <i>git
rerere</i> may fail to record a conflict resolution. To work
around this, the <b>conflict-marker-size</b> setting in
<b>gitattributes</b>(5) can be used.</p>
