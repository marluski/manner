<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Less</b> is a
program similar to <b>more</b>(1), but it has many more
features. <b>Less</b> does not have to read the entire input
file before starting, so with large input files it starts up
faster than text editors like <b>vi</b>(1). <b>Less</b> uses
termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a
variety of terminals. There is even limited support for
hardcopy terminals. (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which
should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with
a caret.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Commands are
based on both <b>more</b> and <b>vi</b>. Commands may be
preceded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions
below. The number is used by some commands, as
indicated.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the following
descriptions, ^X means control-X. ESC stands for the ESCAPE
key; for example ESC-v means the two character sequence
&quot;ESCAPE&quot;, then &quot;v&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">SPACE or ^V or f or ^F</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll forward N lines, default
one window (see option -z below). If N is more than the
screen size, only the final screenful is displayed. Warning:
some systems use ^V as a special literalization
character.</p>

screenful, even if it reaches end-of-file in the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E
or j or ^J</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll forward N lines, default
1. The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than
the screen size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">d or ^D</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll forward N lines, default
one half of the screen size. If N is specified, it becomes
the new default for subsequent d and u commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">b or ^B or ESC-v</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll backward N lines,

special job control character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">u or ^U</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">ESC-) or RIGHTARROW</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll horizontally right N
characters, default half the screen width (see the -#
option). If a number N is specified, it becomes the default
for future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands. While the text
is scrolled, it acts as though the -S option (chop lines)
were in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">ESC-( or LEFTARROW</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll horizontally left N
characters, default half the screen width (see the -#
option). If a number N is specified, it becomes the default
for future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">ESC-} or ^RIGHTARROW</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Scroll horizontally right to
show the end of the longest displayed line.</p>

<td width="6%">


<p>F</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Scroll forward, and keep trying to read when the end of
file is reached. Normally this command would be used when
already at the end of the file. It is a way to monitor the
tail of a file which is growing while it is being viewed.
(The behavior is similar to the &quot;tail -f&quot;
command.) To stop waiting for more data, enter the interrupt
character (usually ^C). On systems which support
<b>poll</b>(2) you can also use ^X or the character
specified by the --intr option. If the input is a pipe and
the --exit-follow-on-close option is in effect, <b>less</b>
will automatically stop waiting for data when the input side
of the pipe is closed.</p></td></tr>

<td width="6%">


<p>ESC-F</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Go to line N in the file,
default 1 (beginning of file). (Warning: this may be slow if
N is large.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">G or &gt; or ESC-&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Go to line N in the file,

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Search forward in the file for
the N-th line containing the pattern. N defaults to 1. The
pattern is a regular expression, as recognized by the
regular expression library supplied by your system. By
default, searching is case-sensitive (uppercase and
lowercase are considered different); the -i option can be
used to change this. The search starts at the first line
displayed (but see the -a and -j options, which change
this).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
characters are special if entered at the beginning of the
pattern; they modify the type of search rather than become
part of the pattern: <br>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Examine a new file. If the
filename is missing, the &quot;current&quot; file (see the
:n and :p commands below) from the list of files in the
command line is re-examined. A percent sign (%) in the
filename is replaced by the name of the current file. A
pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of the previously
examined file. However, two consecutive percent signs are
simply replaced with a single percent sign. This allows you
to enter a filename that contains a percent sign in the
name. Similarly, two consecutive pound signs are replaced

shell command, the environment variable named
&quot;LESS_OSC8_xxx&quot; is read, where &quot;xxx&quot; is
the scheme from the URI (the part before the first colon),
or is empty if there is no colon in the URI. The value of
the environment variable is then expanded in the same way as
prompt strings (in particular, any instance of
&quot;%o&quot; is replaced with the URI) to produce an OSC 8

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In a simple
case where the opener accepts the complete URI as a command

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">echo mybrowser

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In other cases,

do some manipulation of the %o value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If the
LESS_OSC8_xxx variable is not set, the variable
LESS_OSC8_ANY is tried. If neither LESS_OSC8_xxx nor
LESS_OSC8_ANY is set, links using the &quot;xxx&quot; scheme
cannot be opened. However, there are default handlers for
the schemes &quot;man&quot; (used when LESS_OSC8_man is not
set) and &quot;file&quot; (used when LESS_OSC8_file is not
set), which should work on systems which provide the
<b>sed</b>(1) command and a shell with syntax compatible
with the Bourne shell <b>sh</b>(1). If you use LESS_OSC8_ANY
to override LESS_OSC8_file, you must set LESS_OSC8_file to
&quot;-&quot; to indicate that the default value should not
be used, and likewise for LESS_OSC8_man.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The URI passed
to an OSC8 handler via %o is guaranteed not to contain any
single quote or double quote characters, but it may contain
any other shell metacharacters such as semicolons, dollar
signs, ampersands, etc. The handler should take care to
appropriately quote parameters in the opener command, to
prevent execution of unintended shell commands in the case
of opening a URI which contains shell metacharacters. Also,
since the handler command is expanded like a command prompt,
any metacharacters interpreted by prompt expansion (such as
percent, dot, colon, backslash, etc.) must be escaped with a
backslash (see the PROMPTS section for details).</p>

necessary to use the R or F command to see more data. The
--intr option can be used to specify a different character

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Command line
options are described below. Most options may be changed
while <b>less</b> is running, via the &quot;-&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some options may
be given in one of two forms: either a dash followed by a
single letter, or two dashes followed by a long option name.
A long option name may be abbreviated as long as the
abbreviation is unambiguous. For example, --quit-at-eof may
be abbreviated --quit, but not --qui, since both
--quit-at-eof and --quiet begin with --qui. Some long option
names are in uppercase, such as --QUIT-AT-EOF, as distinct
from --quit-at-eof. Such option names need only have their
first letter capitalized; the remainder of the name may be
in either case. For example, --Quit-at-eof is equivalent to
--QUIT-AT-EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Options are also
taken from the environment variable &quot;LESS&quot;. For
example, to avoid typing &quot;less -options ...&quot; each
time <b>less</b> is invoked, you might tell <b>csh</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">setenv LESS
&quot;-options&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">or if you use
<b>sh</b>:</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LESS=&quot;-options&quot;;
export LESS</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On MS-DOS and
Windows, you don&rsquo;t need the quotes, but you should be
careful that any percent signs in the options string are not
interpreted as an environment variable expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
variable is parsed before the command line, so command line
options override the LESS environment variable. If an option
appears in the LESS variable, it can be reset to its default
value on the command line by beginning the command line
option with &quot;-+&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some options
like -k or -D require a string to follow the option letter.
The string for that option is considered to end when a
dollar sign ($) is found. For example, you can set two -D
options like this:</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LESS=&quot;Dnwb$Dsbw&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the
--use-backslash option appears earlier in the options, then
a dollar sign or backslash may be included literally in an
option string by preceding it with a backslash. If the
--use-backslash option is not in effect, then backslashes
are not treated specially, and there is no way to include a
dollar sign in the option string. <br>
-? or --help</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This option displays a summary
of the commands accepted by <b>less</b> (the same as the h
command). (Depending on how your shell interprets the
question mark, it may be necessary to quote the question
mark, thus: &quot;-\?&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-a or --search-skip-screen</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">By default, forward searches
start at the top of the displayed screen and backwards
searches start at the bottom of the displayed screen (except
for repeated searches invoked by the n or N commands, which
start after or before the &quot;target&quot; line
respectively; see the -j option for more about the target
line). The -a option causes forward searches to instead
start at the bottom of the screen and backward searches to
start at the top of the screen, thus skipping all lines
displayed on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-A or --SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes all forward searches
(not just non-repeated searches) to start just after the
target line, and all backward searches to start just before
the target line. Thus, forward searches will skip part of
the displayed screen (from the first line up to and
including the target line). Similarly backwards searches
will skip the displayed screen from the last line up to and
including the target line. This was the default behavior in
less versions prior to 441.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-b<i>n</i> or
--buffers=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the amount of buffer
space <b>less</b> will use for each file, in units of
kilobytes (1024 bytes). By default 64&nbsp;KB of buffer
space is used for each file (unless the file is a pipe; see
the -B option). The -b option specifies instead that
<i>n</i> kilobytes of buffer space should be used for each
file. If <i>n</i> is -1, buffer space is unlimited; that is,
the entire file can be read into memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-B or --auto-buffers</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">By default, when data is read
from a pipe, buffers are allocated automatically as needed.
If a large amount of data is read from the pipe, this can
cause a large amount of memory to be allocated. The -B
option disables this automatic allocation of buffers for
pipes, so that only 64&nbsp;KB (or the amount of space
specified by the -b option) is used for the pipe. Warning:
use of -B can result in erroneous display, since only the
most recently viewed part of the piped data is kept in
memory; any earlier data is lost. Lost characters are
displayed as question marks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-c or --clear-screen</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes full screen repaints to
be painted from the top line down. By default, full screen
repaints are done by scrolling from the bottom of the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-C or --CLEAR-SCREEN</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Same as -c, for compatibility
with older versions of <b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-d or --dumb</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The -d option suppresses the
error message normally displayed if the terminal is dumb;
that is, lacks some important capability, such as the
ability to clear the screen or scroll backward. The -d
option does not otherwise change the behavior of <b>less</b>
on a dumb terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-D<b>x</b><i>color</i> or
--color=<b>x</b><i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Changes the color of different
parts of the displayed text. <b>x</b> is a single character
which selects the type of text whose color is being set:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The uppercase
letters and digits can be used only when the --use-color
option is enabled. When text color is specified by both an
uppercase letter and a lowercase letter, the uppercase
letter takes precedence. For example, error messages are
normally displayed as standout text. So if both
&quot;s&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are given a color, the
&quot;E&quot; color applies to error messages, and the
&quot;s&quot; color applies to other standout text. The
lowercase letters refer to bold and underline text formed by
overstriking with backspaces (see the -U option) and to
non-content text (such as line numbers and prompts), but not
to text formatted using ANSI escape sequences with the -R
option (but see the note below for different behavior on
Windows and MS-DOS).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A lowercase
letter may be followed by a + to indicate that the normal
format change and the specified color should both be used.
For example, -Dug displays underlined text as green without
underlining; the green color has replaced the usual
underline formatting. But -Du+g displays underlined text as
both green and in underlined format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><i>color</i> is

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-e or --quit-at-eof</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to
automatically exit the second time it reaches end-of-file.
By default, the only way to exit <b>less</b> is via the
&quot;q&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-E or --QUIT-AT-EOF</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to
automatically exit the first time it reaches
end-of-file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-f or --force</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Forces non-regular files to be
opened. (A non-regular file is a directory or a device
special file.) Also suppresses the warning message when a
binary file is opened. By default, <b>less</b> will refuse
to open non-regular files. Note that some operating systems
will not allow directories to be read, even if -f is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-F or --quit-if-one-screen</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to
automatically exit if the entire file can be displayed on
the first screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-g or --hilite-search</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Normally, <b>less</b> will
highlight ALL strings which match the last search command.
The -g option changes this behavior to highlight only the
particular string which was found by the last search
command. This can cause <b>less</b> to run somewhat faster
than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-G or --HILITE-SEARCH</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The -G option suppresses all
highlighting of strings found by search commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-h<i>n</i> or
--max-back-scroll=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a maximum number of
lines to scroll backward. If it is necessary to scroll
backward more than <i>n</i> lines, the screen is repainted
in a forward direction instead. (If the terminal does not
have the ability to scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-i or --ignore-case</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes searches to ignore case;
that is, uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.
This option is ignored if any uppercase letters appear in
the search pattern; in other words, if a pattern contains
uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-I or --IGNORE-CASE</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Like -i, but searches ignore
case even if the pattern contains uppercase letters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-j<i>n</i> or
--jump-target=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a line on the screen
where the &quot;target&quot; line is to be positioned. The
target line is the line specified by any command to search
for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a file
percentage or jump to a tag. The screen line may be
specified by a number: the top line on the screen is 1, the
next is 2, and so on. The number may be negative to specify
a line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line
on the screen is -1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so
on. Alternately, the screen line may be specified as a
fraction of the height of the screen, starting with a
decimal point: .5 is in the middle of the screen, .3 is
three tenths down from the first line, and so on. If the
line is specified as a fraction, the actual line number is
recalculated if the terminal window is resized. If the
--header option is used and the target line specified by -j
would be obscured by the header, the target line is moved to
the first line after the header. While the --header option
is active, the -S option is ignored, and lines longer than
the screen width are truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If any form of
the -j option is used, repeated forward searches (invoked
with &quot;n&quot; or &quot;N&quot;) begin at the line
immediately after the target line, and repeated backward
searches begin at the target line, unless changed by -a or
-A. For example, if &quot;-j4&quot; is used, the target line
is the fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin
at the fifth line on the screen. However nonrepeated
searches (invoked with &quot;/&quot; or &quot;?&quot;)
always begin at the start or end of the current screen
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-J or --status-column</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Displays a status column at the
left edge of the screen. The character displayed in the
status column may be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">The line has been marked with
the corresponding letter via the m command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-k<i>filename</i> or
--lesskey-file=<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to open and
interpret the named file as a <b>lesskey</b>(1) binary file.
Multiple -k options may be specified. If the LESSKEY or
LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or if a lesskey
file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is
also used as a <b>lesskey</b> file. Note the warning under
&quot;--lesskey-content&quot; below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;">--lesskey-src=<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to open and
interpret the named file as a <b>lesskey</b>(1) source file.
If the LESSKEYIN or LESSKEYIN_SYSTEM environment variable is
set, or if a lesskey source file is found in a standard
place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a <i>lesskey
source</i> file. Prior to version 582, the <b>lesskey</b>
program needed to be run to convert a <i>lesskey source</i>
file to a <i>lesskey binary</i> file for <b>less</b> to use.
Newer versions of <b>less</b> read the <i>lesskey source</i>
file directly and ignore the binary file if the source file
exists. Note the warning under &quot;--lesskey-content&quot;
below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;">--lesskey-content=<i>text</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes less to interpret the
specified text as the contents of a <b>lesskey</b>(1) source
file. In the text, <b>lesskey</b> lines may be separated by
either newlines as usual, or by semicolons. A literal
semicolon may be represented by a backslash followed by a
semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Warning:
certain environment variables such as LESS, LESSSECURE,
LESSCHARSET and others, which are used early in startup,
cannot be set in a file specified by a command line option
(--lesskey, --lesskey-src or --lesskey-content). When using
a <b>lesskey</b> file to set environment variables, it is
safer to use the default lesskey file, or to specify the
file using the LESSKEYIN or LESSKEY_CONTENT environment
variables rather than using a command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-K or --quit-on-intr</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to exit
immediately (with status 2) when an interrupt character
(usually ^C) is typed. Normally, an interrupt character
causes <b>less</b> to stop whatever it is doing and return
to its command prompt. Note that use of this option makes it
impossible to return to the command prompt from the
&quot;F&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-L or --no-lessopen</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Ignore the LESSOPEN environment
variable (see the INPUT PREPROCESSOR section below). This
option can be set from within <b>less</b>, but it will apply
only to files opened subsequently, not to the file which is
currently open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-m or --long-prompt</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to prompt
verbosely (like <b>more</b>(1)), with the percent into the
file. By default, <b>less</b> prompts with a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-M or --LONG-PROMPT</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to prompt
even more verbosely than <b>more</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-n or --line-numbers</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Suppresses line numbers. The
default (to use line numbers) may cause <b>less</b> to run
more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large
input file. Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will
avoid this problem. Using line numbers means: the line
number will be displayed in the verbose prompt and in the =
command, and the v command will pass the current line number
to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in
PROMPTS below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-N or --LINE-NUMBERS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes a line number to be
displayed at the beginning of each line in the display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-o<i>filename</i> or
--log-file=<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes <b>less</b> to copy its
input to the named file as it is being viewed. This applies
only when the input file is a pipe, not an ordinary file. If
the file already exists, <b>less</b> will ask for
confirmation before overwriting it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-O<i>filename</i> or
--LOG-FILE=<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The -O option is like -o, but
it will overwrite an existing file without asking for
confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If no log file
has been specified, the -o and -O options can be used from
within <b>less</b> to specify a log file. Without a file
name, they will simply report the name of the log file. The
&quot;s&quot; command is equivalent to specifying -o from
within <b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-p<i>pattern</i> or
--pattern=<i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The -p option on the command
line is equivalent to specifying +/<i>pattern</i>; that is,
it tells <b>less</b> to start at the first occurrence of
<i>pattern</i> in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-P<i>prompt</i> or
--prompt=<i>prompt</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Provides a way to tailor the
three prompt styles to your own preference. This option
would normally be put in the LESS environment variable,
rather than being typed in with each <b>less</b> command.
Such an option must either be the last option in the LESS
variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign. <br>
-Ps followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt
to that string. <br>
-Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt. <br>
-PM changes the long (-M) prompt. <br>
-Ph changes the prompt for the help screen. <br>
-P= changes the message printed by the = command. <br>
-Pw changes the message printed while waiting for data (in
the &quot;F&quot; command).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">All prompt
strings consist of a sequence of letters and special escape
sequences. See the section on PROMPTS for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-q or --quiet or --silent</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes moderately
&quot;quiet&quot; operation: the terminal bell is not rung
if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file or
before the beginning of the file. If the terminal has a
&quot;visual bell&quot;, it is used instead. The bell will
be rung on certain other errors, such as typing an invalid
character. The default is to ring the terminal bell in all
such cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-Q or --QUIET or --SILENT</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes totally
&quot;quiet&quot; operation: the terminal bell is never
rung. If the terminal has a &quot;visual bell&quot;, it is
used in all cases where the terminal bell would have been
rung.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-r or --raw-control-chars</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes &quot;raw&quot; control
characters to be displayed. The default is to display
control characters using the caret notation; for example, a
control-A (octal 001) is displayed as &quot;^A&quot; (with
some exceptions as described under the -U option). Warning:
when the -r option is used, <b>less</b> cannot keep track of
the actual appearance of the screen (since this depends on
how the screen responds to each type of control character).
Thus, various display problems may result, such as long
lines being split in the wrong place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">USE OF THE -r
OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Like -r, but only ANSI
&quot;color&quot; escape sequences and OSC 8 hyperlink
sequences are output in &quot;raw&quot; form. Unlike -r, the
screen appearance is maintained correctly, provided that
there are no escape sequences in the file other than these
types of escape sequences. Color escape sequences are only
supported when the color is changed within one line, not
across lines. In other words, the beginning of each line is
assumed to be normal (non-colored), regardless of any escape
sequences in previous lines. For the purpose of keeping
track of screen appearance, these escape sequences are
assumed to not move the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">OSC 8
hyperlinks are sequences of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">ESC ] 8 ; ...
\7</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The terminating
sequence may be either a BEL character (\7) or the
two-character sequence &quot;ESC \&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">ANSI color
escape sequences are sequences of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">ESC [ ... m</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">where the
&quot;...&quot; is zero or more color specification
characters. You can make <b>less</b> think that characters
other than &quot;m&quot; can end ANSI color escape sequences
by setting the environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to the
list of characters which can end a color escape sequence.
And you can make <b>less</b> think that characters other
than the standard ones may appear between the ESC and the m
by setting the environment variable LESSANSIMIDCHARS to the
list of characters which can appear.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-s or --squeeze-blank-lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes consecutive blank lines
to be squeezed into a single blank line. This is useful when
viewing <b>nroff</b> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-S or --chop-long-lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes lines longer than the
screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped.
That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in the
screen width is not displayed until you press RIGHT-ARROW.
The default is to wrap long lines; that is, display the
remainder on the next line. See also the --wordwrap
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-t<i>tag</i> or
--tag=<i>tag</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The -t option, followed
immediately by a TAG, will edit the file containing that
tag. For this to work, tag information must be available;
for example, there may be a file in the current directory
called &quot;tags&quot;, which was previously built by
<b>ctags</b>(1) or an equivalent command. If the environment
variable LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it is taken to be the name
of a command compatible with <b>global</b>(1), and that
command is executed to find the tag. (See
http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). The -t
option may also be specified from within <b>less</b> (using
the - command) as a way of examining a new file. The command
&quot;:t&quot; is equivalent to specifying -t from within
<b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-T<i>tagsfile</i> or
--tag-file=<i>tagsfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a tags file to be
used instead of &quot;tags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-u or --underline-special</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes backspaces and carriage
returns to be treated as printable characters; that is, they
are sent to the terminal when they appear in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-U or --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes backspaces, tabs,
carriage returns and &quot;formatting characters&quot; (as
defined by Unicode) to be treated as control characters;
that is, they are handled as specified by the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">By default, if
neither -u nor -U is given, backspaces which appear adjacent
to an underscore character are treated specially: the
underlined text is displayed using the terminal&rsquo;s
hardware underlining capability. Also, backspaces which
appear between two identical characters are treated
specially: the overstruck text is printed using the
terminal&rsquo;s hardware boldface capability. Other
backspaces are deleted, along with the preceding character.
Carriage returns immediately followed by a newline are
deleted. Other carriage returns are handled as specified by
the -r option. Unicode formatting characters, such as the
Byte Order Mark, are sent to the terminal. Text which is
overstruck or underlined can be searched for if neither -u
nor -U is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
--proc-backspace, --proc-tab, and --proc-return options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-V or --version</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Displays the version number of
<b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-w or --hilite-unread</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Temporarily highlights the
first &quot;new&quot; line after a forward movement of a
full page. The first &quot;new&quot; line is the line
immediately following the line previously at the bottom of
the screen. Also highlights the target line after a g or p
command. The highlight is removed at the next command which
causes movement. If the --status-line option is in effect,
the entire line (the width of the screen) is highlighted.
Otherwise, only the text in the line is highlighted, unless
the -J option is in effect, in which case only the status
column is highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-W or --HILITE-UNREAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Like -w, but temporarily
highlights the first new line after any forward movement
command larger than one line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-x<i>n</i>,... or
--tabs=<i>n</i>,...</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets tab stops. If only one
<i>n</i> is specified, tab stops are set at multiples of
<i>n</i>. If multiple values separated by commas are
specified, tab stops are set at those positions, and then
continue with the same spacing as the last two. For example,
&quot;-x9,17&quot; will set tabs at positions 9, 17, 25, 33,
etc. The default for <i>n</i> is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-X or --no-init</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Disables sending the termcap
initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.
This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization string
does something unnecessary, like clearing the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-y<i>n</i> or
--max-forw-scroll=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a maximum number of
lines to scroll forward. If it is necessary to scroll
forward more than <i>n</i> lines, the screen is repainted
instead. The -c or -C option may be used to repaint from the
top of the screen if desired. By default, any forward
movement causes scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-z<i>n</i> or --window=<i>n</i>
or -<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Changes the default scrolling
window size to <i>n</i> lines. The default is one screenful.
The z and w commands can also be used to change the window
size. The &quot;z&quot; may be omitted for compatibility
with some versions of <b>more</b>(1). If the number <i>n</i>
is negative, it indicates <i>n</i> lines less than the
current screen size. For example, if the screen is 24 lines,
<i>-z-4</i> sets the scrolling window to 20 lines. If the
screen is resized to 40 lines, the scrolling window
automatically changes to 36 lines.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;">-&quot;<i>cc&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;--quotes=<i>cc</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Changes the filename quoting
character. This may be necessary if you are trying to name a
file which contains both spaces and quote characters.
Followed by a single character, this changes the quote
character to that character. Filenames containing a space
should then be surrounded by that character rather than by
double quotes. Followed by two characters, changes the open
quote to the first character, and the close quote to the
second character. Filenames containing a space should then
be preceded by the open quote character and followed by the
close quote character. Note that even after the quote
characters are changed, this option remains -&quot; (a dash
followed by a double quote).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-~ or --tilde</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Normally lines after end of
file are displayed as a single tilde (~). This option causes
lines after end of file to be displayed as blank lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">-# or --shift</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the default number of
positions to scroll horizontally in the RIGHTARROW and
LEFTARROW commands. If the number specified is zero, it sets
the default number of positions to one half of the screen
width. Alternately, the number may be specified as a
fraction of the width of the screen, starting with a decimal
point: .5 is half of the screen width, .3 is three tenths of
the screen width, and so on. If the number is specified as a
fraction, the actual number of scroll positions is
recalculated if the terminal window is resized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--exit-follow-on-close</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When using the &quot;F&quot;
command on a pipe, <b>less</b> will automatically stop
waiting for more data when the input side of the pipe is
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--file-size</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If --file-size is specified,
<b>less</b> will determine the size of the file immediately
after opening the file. Then the &quot;=&quot; command will
display the number of lines in the file. Normally this is
not done, because it can be slow if the input file is
non-seekable (such as a pipe) and is large.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--follow-name</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Normally, if the input file is
renamed while an F command is executing, <b>less</b> will
continue to display the contents of the original file
despite its name change. If --follow-name is specified,
during an F command <b>less</b> will periodically attempt to
reopen the file by name. If the reopen succeeds and the file
is a different file from the original (which means that a
new file has been created with the same name as the original
(now renamed) file), <b>less</b> will display the contents
of that new file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;">--header=<i>L</i>,<i>C</i>,<i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the number of header lines
and columns displayed on the screen. The number of header
lines is set to <i>L</i>. If <i>L</i> is 0, header lines are
disabled. If <i>L</i> is empty or missing, the number of
header lines is unchanged. The number of header columns is
set to <i>C</i>. If <i>C</i> is 0, header columns are
disabled. If <i>C</i> is empty or missing, the number of
header columns is unchanged. The first header line is set to
line number <i>N</i> in the file. If <i>N</i> is empty or
missing, it is taken to be the number of the line currently
displayed in the first line of the screen (if the --header
command has been issued from within <b>less</b>), or 1 (if
the --header option has been given on the command line). The
special form &quot;--header=-&quot; disables header lines
and header columns, and is equivalent to
&quot;--header=0,0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When <i>L</i>
is nonzero, the first <i>L</i> lines at the top of the
screen are replaced with the <i>L</i> lines of the file
beginning at line <i>N</i>, regardless of what part of the
file is being viewed. When header lines are displayed, any
file contents before the header line cannot be viewed. When
<i>C</i> is nonzero, the first <i>C</i> characters displayed
at the beginning of each line are replaced with the first
<i>C</i> characters of the line, even if the rest of the
line is scrolled horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--incsearch</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Subsequent search commands will
be &quot;incremental&quot;; that is, <b>less</b> will
advance to the next line containing the search pattern as
each character of the pattern is typed in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--intr=<i>c</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the character <i>c</i>
instead of ^X to interrupt a read when the &quot;Waiting for
data&quot; message is displayed. <i>c</i> must be an ASCII
character; that is, one with a value between 1 and 127
inclusive. A caret followed by a single character can be
used to specify a control character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--line-num-width=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the minimum width of the
line number field when the -N option is in effect to
<i>n</i> characters. The default is 7.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--match-shift=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When -S is in effect, if a
search match is not visible because it is shifted to the
left or right of the currently visible screen, the text will
horizontally shift to ensure that the search match is
visible. This option selects the column in which the first
character of the search match will be placed after the
shift. In other words, there will be <i>n</i> characters
visible to the left of the search match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Alternately,
the number may be specified as a fraction of the width of
the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is half of the
screen width, .3 is three tenths of the screen width, and so
on. If the number is specified as a fraction, the actual
number of scroll positions is recalculated if the terminal
window is resized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--modelines=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Before displaying a file,
<b>less</b> will read the first <i>n</i> lines to try to
find a vim-compatible <i>modeline</i>. If <i>n</i> is zero,
<b>less</b> does not try to find modelines. By using a
modeline, the file itself can specify the tab stops that
should be used when viewing it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A modeline
contains, anywhere in the line, a program name
(&quot;vi&quot;, &quot;vim&quot;, &quot;ex&quot;, or
&quot;less&quot;), followed by a colon, possibly followed by
the word &quot;set&quot;, and finally followed by zero or
more option settings. If the word &quot;set&quot; is used,
option settings are separated by spaces, and end at the
first colon. If the word &quot;set&quot; is not used, option
settings may be separated by either spaces or colons. The
word &quot;set&quot; is required if the program name is
&quot;less&quot; but optional if any of the other three
names are used. If any option setting is of the form
&quot;tabstop=<i>n</i>&quot; or &quot;ts=<i>n</i>&quot;,
then tab stops are automatically set as if --tabs=<i>n</i>
had been given. See the --tabs description for acceptable
values of <i>n</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--mouse</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enables mouse input: scrolling
the mouse wheel down moves forward in the file, scrolling
the mouse wheel up moves backwards in the file, left-click
sets the &quot;#&quot; mark to the line where the mouse is
clicked, and right-click (or any other) returns to the
&quot;#&quot; mark position. If a left-click is performed
with the mouse cursor on an OSC 8 hyperlink, the hyperlink
is selected as if by the ^O^N command. If a left-click is
performed with the mouse cursor on an OSC 8 hyperlink which
is already selected, the hyperlink is opened as if by the
^O^O command. The number of lines to scroll when the wheel
is moved can be set by the --wheel-lines option. Mouse input
works only on terminals which support X11 mouse reporting,
and on the Windows version of <b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--MOUSE</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Like --mouse, except the
direction scrolled on mouse wheel movement is reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-keypad</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Disables sending the keypad
initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.
This is sometimes useful if the keypad strings make the
numeric keypad behave in an undesirable manner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-histdups</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This option changes the
behavior so that if a search string or file name is typed
in, and the same string is already in the history list, the
existing copy is removed from the history list before the
new one is added. Thus, a given string will appear only once
in the history list. Normally, a string may appear multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-number-headers</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Header lines (defined via the
--header option) are not assigned line numbers. Line number
1 is assigned to the first line after any header lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-search-header-lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Searches do not include header
lines, but still include header columns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-search-header-columns</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Searches do not include header
columns, but still include header lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-search-headers</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Searches do not include header
lines or header columns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--no-vbell</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Disables the terminal&rsquo;s
visual bell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--proc-backspace</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, backspaces are handled
as if neither the -u option nor the -U option were set. That
is, a backspace adjacent to an underscore causes text to be
displayed in underline mode, and a backspace between
identical characters cause text to be displayed in boldface
mode. This option overrides the -u and -U options, so that
display of backspaces can be controlled separate from tabs
and carriage returns. If not set, backspace display is
controlled by the -u and -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--PROC-BACKSPACE</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, backspaces are handled
as if the -U option were set; that is backspaces are treated
as control characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--proc-return</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, carriage returns are
handled as if neither the -u option nor the -U option were
set. That is, a carriage return immediately before a newline
is deleted. This option overrides the -u and -U options, so
that display of carriage returns can be controlled separate
from that of backspaces and tabs. If not set, carriage
return display is controlled by the -u and -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--PROC-RETURN</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, carriage returns are
handled as if the -U option were set; that is carriage
returns are treated as control characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--proc-tab</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, tabs are handled as if
the -U option were not set. That is, tabs are expanded to
spaces. This option overrides the -U option, so that display
of tabs can be controlled separate from that of backspaces
and carriage returns. If not set, tab display is controlled
by the -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--PROC-TAB</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If set, tabs are handled as if
the -U option were set; that is tabs are treated as control
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--redraw-on-quit</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When quitting, after sending
the terminal deinitialization string, redraws the entire
last screen. On terminals whose terminal deinitialization
string causes the terminal to switch from an alternate
screen, this makes the last screenful of the current file
remain visible after <b>less</b> has quit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--rscroll=<i>c</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This option changes the
character used to mark truncated lines. It may begin with a
two-character attribute indicator like LESSBINFMT does. If
there is no attribute indicator, standout is used. If set to
&quot;-&quot;, truncated lines are not marked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--save-marks</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Save marks in the history file,
so marks are retained across different invocations of
<b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--search-options=<i>...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets default search modifiers.
The value is a string of one or more of the characters E, F,
K, N, R or W. Setting any of these has the same effect as
typing that control character at the beginning of every
search pattern. For example, setting --search-options=W is
the same as typing ^W at the beginning of every pattern. The
value may also contain a digit between 1 and 5, which has
the same effect as typing ^S followed by that digit at the
beginning of every search pattern. The value &quot;-&quot;
disables all default search modifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--show-preproc-errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If a preprocessor produces
data, then exits with a non-zero exit code, <b>less</b> will
display a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--status-col-width=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the width of the status
column when the -J option is in effect. The default is 2
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--status-line</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If a line is marked, the entire
line (rather than just the status column) is highlighted.
Also lines highlighted due to the -w option will have the
entire line highlighted. If --use-color is set, the line is
colored rather than highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--use-backslash</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This option changes the
interpretations of options which follow this one. After the
--use-backslash option, any backslash in an option string is
removed and the following character is taken literally. This
allows a dollar sign to be included in option strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--use-color</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enables colored text in various
places. The -D option can be used to change the colors.
Colored text works only if the terminal supports ANSI color
escape sequences (as defined in
https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--wheel-lines=<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the number of lines to
scroll when the mouse wheel is scrolled and the --mouse or
--MOUSE option is in effect. The default is 1 line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">--wordwrap</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When the -S option is not in
use, wrap each line at a space or tab if possible, so that a
word is not split between two lines. The default is to wrap
at any character.</p>

<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>--</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>A command line argument of &quot;--&quot; marks the end
of option arguments. Any arguments following this are
interpreted as filenames. This can be useful when viewing a
file whose name begins with a &quot;-&quot; or
&quot;+&quot;.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>+</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>If a command line option begins with <b>+</b>, the
remainder of that option is taken to be an initial command
to <b>less</b>. For example, +G tells <b>less</b> to start
at the end of the file rather than the beginning, and +/xyz
tells it to start at the first occurrence of &quot;xyz&quot;
in the file. As a special case, +&lt;number&gt; acts like
+&lt;number&gt;g; that is, it starts the display at the
specified line number (however, see the caveat under the
&quot;g&quot; command above). If the option starts with ++,
the initial command applies to every file being viewed, not
just the first one. The + command described previously may
also be used to set (or change) an initial command for every
file.</p> </td></tr>

<h2>LINE EDITING
<a name="LINE EDITING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When entering a
command line at the bottom of the screen (for example, a
filename for the :e command, or the pattern for a search
command), certain keys can be used to manipulate the command
line. Most commands have an alternate form in [ brackets ]
which can be used if a key does not exist on a particular
keyboard. (Note that the forms beginning with ESC do not
work in some MS-DOS and Windows systems because ESC is the
line erase character.) Any of these special keys may be
entered literally by preceding it with the

<h2>KEY BINDINGS
<a name="KEY BINDINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You may define
your own <b>less</b> commands by creating a lesskey source
file. This file specifies a set of command keys and an
action associated with each key. You may also change the
line-editing keys (see LINE EDITING), and set environment
variables used by <b>less</b>. See the <b>lesskey</b>(1)
manual page for details about the file format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variable LESSKEYIN is set, <b>less</b> uses that
as the name of the lesskey source file. Otherwise,
<b>less</b> looks in a standard place for the lesskey source
file: On Unix systems, <b>less</b> looks for a lesskey file
called &quot;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lesskey&quot; or
&quot;$HOME/.config/lesskey&quot; or
&quot;$HOME/.lesskey&quot;. On MS-DOS and Windows systems,
<b>less</b> looks for a lesskey file called
&quot;$HOME/_lesskey&quot;, and if it is not found there,
then looks for a lesskey file called &quot;_lesskey&quot; in
any directory specified in the PATH environment variable. On
OS/2 systems, <b>less</b> looks for a lesskey file called
&quot;$HOME/lesskey.ini&quot;, and if it is not found, then
looks for a lesskey file called &quot;lesskey.ini&quot; in
any directory specified in the INIT environment variable,
and if it not found there, then looks for a lesskey file
called &quot;lesskey.ini&quot; in any directory specified in
the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A system-wide
lesskey source file may also be set up to provide key
bindings. If a key is defined in both a local lesskey file
and in the system-wide file, key bindings in the local file
take precedence over those in the system-wide file. If the
environment variable LESSKEYIN_SYSTEM is set, <b>less</b>
uses that as the name of the system-wide lesskey file.
Otherwise, <b>less</b> looks in a standard place for the
system-wide lesskey file: On Unix systems, the system-wide
lesskey file is /usr/local/etc/syslesskey. (However, if
<b>less</b> was built with a different sysconf directory
than /usr/local/etc, that directory is where the sysless
file is found.) On MS-DOS and Windows systems, the
system-wide lesskey file is c:\_syslesskey. On OS/2 systems,
the system-wide lesskey file is c:\syslesskey.ini.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Previous
versions of <b>less</b> (before v582) used lesskey files
with a binary format, produced by the <b>lesskey</b>
program. It is no longer necessary to use the <b>lesskey</b>
program.</p>

<h2>INPUT PREPROCESSOR
<a name="INPUT PREPROCESSOR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You may define
an &quot;input preprocessor&quot; for <b>less</b>. Before
<b>less</b> opens a file, it first gives your input
preprocessor a chance to modify the way the contents of the
file are displayed. An input preprocessor is simply an
executable program (or shell script), which writes the
contents of the file to a different file, called the
replacement file. The contents of the replacement file are
then displayed in place of the contents of the original
file. However, it will appear to the user as if the original
file is opened; that is, <b>less</b> will display the
original filename as the name of the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An input
preprocessor receives one command line argument, the
original filename, as entered by the user. It should create
the replacement file, and when finished, print the name of
the replacement file to its standard output. If the input
preprocessor does not output a replacement filename,
<b>less</b> uses the original file, as normal. The input
preprocessor is not called when viewing standard input. To
set up an input preprocessor, set the LESSOPEN environment
variable to a command line which will invoke your input
preprocessor. This command line should include one
occurrence of the string &quot;%s&quot;, which will be
replaced by the filename when the input preprocessor command
is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When <b>less</b>
closes a file opened in such a way, it will call another
program, called the input postprocessor, which may perform
any desired clean-up action (such as deleting the
replacement file created by LESSOPEN). This program receives
two command line arguments, the original filename as entered
by the user, and the name of the replacement file. To set up
an input postprocessor, set the LESSCLOSE environment
variable to a command line which will invoke your input
postprocessor. It may include two occurrences of the string
&quot;%s&quot;; the first is replaced with the original name
of the file and the second with the name of the replacement
file, which was output by LESSOPEN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For example, on
many Unix systems, these two scripts will allow you to keep
files in compressed format, but still let <b>less</b> view
them directly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">lessopen.sh:
<br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
*.Z) TEMPFILE=$(mktemp) <br>
uncompress -c $1 &gt;$TEMPFILE 2&gt;/dev/null <br>
if [ -s $TEMPFILE ]; then <br>
echo $TEMPFILE <br>
else <br>
rm -f $TEMPFILE <br>
fi <br>
;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">lessclose.sh:
<br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
rm $2</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To use these
scripts, put them both where they can be executed and set
LESSOPEN=&quot;lessopen.sh&nbsp;%s&quot;, and
LESSCLOSE=&quot;lessclose.sh&nbsp;%s&nbsp;%s&quot;. More
complex LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE scripts may be written to
accept other types of compressed files, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to set up an input preprocessor to pipe the file
data directly to <b>less</b>, rather than putting the data
into a replacement file. This avoids the need to decompress
the entire file before starting to view it. An input
preprocessor that works this way is called an input pipe. An
input pipe, instead of writing the name of a replacement
file on its standard output, writes the entire contents of
the replacement file on its standard output. If the input
pipe does not write any characters on its standard output,
then there is no replacement file and <b>less</b> uses the
original file, as normal. To use an input pipe, make the
first character in the LESSOPEN environment variable a
vertical bar (|) to signify that the input preprocessor is
an input pipe. As with non-pipe input preprocessors, the
command string must contain one occurrence of %s, which is
replaced with the filename of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For example, on
many Unix systems, this script will work like the previous
example scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">lesspipe.sh:
<br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
*.Z) uncompress -c $1 2&gt;/dev/null <br>
;; <br>
*) exit 1 <br>
;; <br>
esac <br>
exit $?</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To use this
script, put it where it can be executed and set
LESSOPEN=&quot;|lesspipe.sh %s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
preprocessor cannot output an empty file, since that is
interpreted as meaning there is no replacement, and the
original file is used. To avoid this, if LESSOPEN starts
with two vertical bars, the exit status of the script
determines the behavior when the output is empty. If the
output is empty and the exit status is zero, the empty
output is considered to be replacement text. If the output
is empty and the exit status is nonzero, the original file
is used. For compatibility with previous versions of
<b>less</b>, if LESSOPEN starts with only one vertical bar,
the exit status of the preprocessor is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When an input
pipe is used, a LESSCLOSE postprocessor can be used, but it
is usually not necessary since there is no replacement file
to clean up. In this case, the replacement file name passed
to the LESSCLOSE postprocessor is &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For
compatibility with previous versions of <b>less</b>, the
input preprocessor or pipe is not used if <b>less</b> is
viewing standard input. However, if the first character of
LESSOPEN is a dash (-), the input preprocessor is used on
standard input as well as other files. In this case, the
dash is not considered to be part of the preprocessor
command. If standard input is being viewed, the input
preprocessor is passed a file name consisting of a single
dash. Similarly, if the first two characters of LESSOPEN are
vertical bar and dash (|-) or two vertical bars and a dash
(||-), the input pipe is used on standard input as well as
other files. Again, in this case the dash is not considered
to be part of the input pipe command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Selects a character set

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In rare cases,
it may be desired to tailor <b>less</b> to use a character
set other than the ones definable by LESSCHARSET. In this
case, the environment variable LESSCHARDEF can be used to
define a character set. It should be set to a string where
each character in the string represents one character in the
character set. The character &quot;.&quot; is used for a
normal character, &quot;c&quot; for control, and
&quot;b&quot; for binary. A decimal number may be used for
repetition. For example, &quot;bccc4b.&quot; would mean
character 0 is binary, 1, 2 and 3 are control, 4, 5, 6 and 7
are binary, and 8 is normal. All characters after the last
are taken to be the same as the last, so characters 9
through 255 would be normal. (This is an example, and does
not necessarily represent any real character set.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This table shows
the value of LESSCHARDEF which is equivalent to each of the
possible values for LESSCHARSET:</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If neither
LESSCHARSET nor LESSCHARDEF is set, but any of the strings
&quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;UTF8&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot; or
&quot;utf8&quot; is found in the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or LANG
environment variables, then the default character set is
utf-8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If that string
is not found, but your system supports the <b>setlocale</b>
interface, <b>less</b> will use setlocale to determine the
character set. setlocale is controlled by setting the LANG
or LC_CTYPE environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if the
<i>setlocale</i> interface is also not available, the
default character set is utf-8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Control and
binary characters are displayed in standout (reverse video).
Each such character is displayed in caret notation if
possible (e.g. ^A for control-A). Caret notation is used
only if inverting the 0100 bit results in a normal printable
character. Otherwise, the character is displayed as a hex
number in angle brackets. This format can be changed by
setting the LESSBINFMT environment variable. LESSBINFMT may
begin with a &quot;*&quot; and one character to select the
display attribute: &quot;*k&quot; is blinking,
&quot;*d&quot; is bold, &quot;*u&quot; is underlined,
&quot;*s&quot; is standout, and &quot;*n&quot; is normal. If
LESSBINFMT does not begin with a &quot;*&quot;, normal
attribute is assumed. The remainder of LESSBINFMT is a
string which may include one printf-style escape sequence (a
% followed by x, X, o, d, etc.). For example, if LESSBINFMT
is &quot;*u[%x]&quot;, binary characters are displayed in
underlined hexadecimal surrounded by brackets. The default
if no LESSBINFMT is specified is &quot;*s&lt;%02X&gt;&quot;.
Warning: the result of expanding the character via
LESSBINFMT must be less than 31 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When the
character set is utf-8, the LESSUTFBINFMT environment
variable acts similarly to LESSBINFMT but it applies to
Unicode code points that were successfully decoded but are
unsuitable for display (e.g., unassigned code points). Its
default value is &quot;&lt;U+%04lX&gt;&quot;. Note that
LESSUTFBINFMT and LESSBINFMT share their display attribute
setting (&quot;*x&quot;) so specifying one will affect both;
LESSUTFBINFMT is read after LESSBINFMT so its setting, if
any, will have priority. Problematic octets in a UTF-8 file
(octets of a truncated sequence, octets of a complete but
non-shortest form sequence, invalid octets, and stray
trailing octets) are displayed individually using LESSBINFMT
so as to facilitate diagnostic of how the UTF-8 file is
ill-formed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When the
character set is utf-8, in rare cases it may be desirable to
override the Unicode definition of the type of certain
characters. For example, characters in a Private Use Area
are normally treated as control characters, but if you are
using a custom font with printable characters in that range,
it may be desirable to tell <b>less</b> to treat such
characters as printable. This can be done by setting the
LESSUTFCHARDEF environment variable to a comma-separated
list of <i>character type</i> definitions. Each character
type definition consists of either one hexadecimal codepoint
or a pair of codepoints separated by a dash, followed by a
colon and a type character. Each hexadecimal codepoint may
optionally be preceded by a &quot;U&quot; or &quot;U+&quot;.
If a pair of codepoints is given, the type is set for all
characters inclusively between the two values. If there are
multiple comma-separated codepoint values, they must be in
ascending numerical order. The type character may be one
of:</p>
