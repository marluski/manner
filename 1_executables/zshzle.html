<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">zshzle - zsh
command line editor</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>ZLE</b> option is set (which it is by default in
interactive shells) and the shell input is attached to the
terminal, the user is able to edit command lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
display modes. The first, multiline mode, is the default. It
only works if the <b>TERM</b> parameter is set to a valid
terminal type that can move the cursor up. The second,
single line mode, is used if <b>TERM</b> is invalid or
incapable of moving the cursor up, or if the
<b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> option is set. This mode is similar
to <b>ksh</b>, and uses no termcap sequences. If <b>TERM</b>
is &quot;emacs&quot;, the <b>ZLE</b> option will be unset by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The parameters
<b>BAUD</b>, <b>COLUMNS</b>, and <b>LINES</b> are also used
by the line editor. See <i>Parameters Used By The Shell</i>
in <i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The parameter
<b>zle_highlight</b> is also used by the line editor; see
<i>Character Highlighting</i> below. Highlighting of special
characters and the region between the cursor and the mark
(as set with <b>set-mark-command</b> in Emacs mode, or by
<b>visual-mode</b> in Vi mode) is enabled by default;
consult this reference for more information. Irascible
conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be
disabled by the following setting:</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle_highlight=(none)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In many places,
references are made to the <b>numeric argument</b>. This can
by default be entered in emacs mode by holding the alt key
and typing a number, or pressing escape before each digit,
and in vi command mode by typing the number before entering
a command. Generally the numeric argument causes the next
command entered to be repeated the specified number of
times, unless otherwise noted below; this is implemented by
the <b>digit-argument</b> widget. See also the
<i>Arguments</i> subsection of the <i>Widgets</i> section
for some other ways the numeric argument can be
modified.</p>

<h2>KEYMAPS
<a name="KEYMAPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A keymap in ZLE
contains a set of bindings between key sequences and ZLE
commands. The empty key sequence cannot be bound.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There can be any
number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one or
more names. If all of a keymap&rsquo;s names are deleted, it
disappears. <b>bindkey</b> can be used to manipulate keymap
names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Initially, there
are eight keymaps:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="42%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>isearch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">incremental search mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>command</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">read a command name</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>.safe</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="19%">


<p>fallback keymap</p></td>
<td width="63%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;<b>.safe</b>&rsquo; keymap is special. It can never
be altered, and the name can never be removed. However, it
can be linked to other names, which can be removed. In the
future other special keymaps may be added; users should
avoid using names beginning with &lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo; for
their own keymaps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
these names, either &lsquo;<b>emacs</b>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<b>viins</b>&rsquo; is also linked to the name
&lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo;. If one of the <b>VISUAL</b> or
<b>EDITOR</b> environment variables contain the string
&lsquo;<b>vi</b>&rsquo; when the shell starts up then it
will be &lsquo;<b>viins</b>&rsquo;, otherwise it will be
&lsquo;<b>emacs</b>&rsquo;. <b>bindkey</b>&rsquo;s <b>-e</b>
and <b>-v</b> options provide a convenient way to override
this default choice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When the editor
starts up, it will select the &lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo;
keymap. If that keymap doesn&rsquo;t exist, it will use
&lsquo;<b>.safe</b>&rsquo; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the
&lsquo;<b>.safe</b>&rsquo; keymap, each single key is bound
to <b>self-insert</b>, except for &#710;J (line feed) and
&#710;M (return) which are bound to <b>accept-line</b>. This
is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it
means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it
back.</p>

<h3>Reading Commands
<a name="Reading Commands"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When ZLE is
reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence
that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a
longer bound string. In this case ZLE will wait a certain
time to see if more characters are typed, and if not (or
they don&rsquo;t match any longer string) it will execute
the binding. This timeout is defined by the
<b>KEYTIMEOUT</b> parameter; its default is 0.4 sec. There
is no timeout if the prefix string is not itself bound to a
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The key timeout
is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from a
multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate
mode. (This requires that the shell was compiled with
multibyte mode enabled; typically also the locale has
characters with the UTF-8 encoding, although any multibyte
encoding known to the operating system is supported.) If the
second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout
period, the shell acts as if <b>?</b> were typed and resets
the input state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As well as ZLE
commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by
using &lsquo;<b>bindkey -s</b>&rsquo;. When such a sequence
is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input, and
the command reading process starts again using these fake
keystrokes. This input can itself invoke further replacement
strings, but in order to detect loops the process will be
stopped if there are twenty such replacements without a real
command being read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A key sequence
typed by the user can be turned into a command name for use
in user-defined widgets with the <b>read-command</b> widget,
described in the subsection &lsquo;Miscellaneous&rsquo; of
the section &lsquo;Standard Widgets&rsquo; below.</p>

<h3>Local Keymaps
<a name="Local Keymaps"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">While for normal
editing a single keymap is used exclusively, in many modes a
local keymap allows for some keys to be customised. For
example, in an incremental search mode, a binding in the
<b>isearch</b> keymap will override a binding in the
<b>main</b> keymap but all keys that are not overridden can
still be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If a key
sequence is defined in a local keymap, it will hide a key
sequence in the global keymap that is a prefix of that
sequence. An example of this occurs with the binding of
<b>iw</b> in <b>viopp</b> as this hides the binding of
<b>i</b> in <b>vicmd</b>. However, a longer sequence in the
global keymap that shares the same prefix can still apply so
for example the binding of <b>&#710;Xa</b> in the global
keymap will be unaffected by the binding of <b>&#710;Xb</b>
in the local keymap.</p>

<h2>ZLE BUILTINS
<a name="ZLE BUILTINS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The ZLE module
contains three related builtin commands. The <b>bindkey</b>
command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the
<b>vared</b> command invokes ZLE on the value of a shell
parameter; and the <b>zle</b> command manipulates editing
widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from
within shell functions. <b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-l</b> [ <b>-L</b> ] [
<i>keymap</i> ... ] <b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-d <br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-D</b> <i>keymap</i> ...
<b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-A</b> <i>old-keymap
new-keymap</i> <b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-N</b> <i>new-keymap</i> [
<i>old-keymap</i> ] <b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-m <br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-r</b> <i>in-string</i>
... <b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <b>-s</b> <i>in-string
out-string</i> ... <b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <i>in-string command</i> ...
<b><br>
bindkey</b> [ <i>options</i> ] [ <i>in-string</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>bindkey</b>&rsquo;s options
can be divided into three categories: keymap selection for
the current command, operation selection, and others. The
keymap selection options are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-e</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="73%">


<p>Selects keymap &lsquo;<b>emacs</b>&rsquo; for any
operations by the current command, and also links
&lsquo;<b>emacs</b>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo; so
that it is selected by default the next time the editor
starts.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-v</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="73%">


<p>Selects keymap &lsquo;<b>viins</b>&rsquo; for any
operations by the current command, and also links
&lsquo;<b>viins</b>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo; so
that it is selected by default the next time the editor
starts.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-a</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="73%">


<p>Selects keymap &lsquo;<b>vicmd</b>&rsquo; for any
operations by the current command.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-M</b> <i>keymap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">The <i>keymap</i> specifies a
keymap name that is selected for any operations by the
current command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If a keymap
selection is required and none of the options above are
used, the &lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo; keymap is used. Some
operations do not permit a keymap to be selected,
namely:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-l</b></p></td>

<td width="73%">


<p>List all existing keymap names; if any arguments are
given, list just those keymaps.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>-L</b> option is also used, list in the form of
<b>bindkey</b> commands to create or link the keymaps.
&lsquo;<b>bindkey -lL main</b>&rsquo; shows which keymap is
linked to &lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo;, if any, and hence if
the standard emacs or vi emulation is in effect. This option
does not show the <b>.safe</b> keymap because it cannot be
created in that fashion; however, neither is
&lsquo;<b>bindkey -lL .safe</b>&rsquo; reported as an error,
it simply outputs nothing.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="18%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-d</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="73%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete all existing keymaps and
reset to the default state.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-D</b> <i>keymap</i> ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Delete the named
<i>keymap</i>s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-A</b> <i>old-keymap
new-keymap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Make the <i>new-keymap</i> name
an alias for <i>old-keymap</i>, so that both names refer to
the same keymap. The names have equal standing; if either is
deleted, the other remains. If there is already a keymap
with the <i>new-keymap</i> name, it is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-N</b> <i>new-keymap</i> [
<i>old-keymap</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Create a new keymap, named
<i>new-keymap</i>. If a keymap already has that name, it is
deleted. If an <i>old-keymap</i> name is given, the new
keymap is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the
new keymap will be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">To use a newly
created keymap, it should be linked to <b>main</b>. Hence
the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap
&lsquo;<b>mymap</b>&rsquo; initialized from the <b>emacs</b>
keymap (which remains unchanged) is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bindkey -N
mymap emacs <br>
bindkey -A mymap main</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that while
&lsquo;<b>bindkey -A</b> <i>newmap</i> <b>main</b>&rsquo;
will work when <i>newmap</i> is <b>emacs</b> or
<b>viins</b>, it will not work for <b>vicmd</b>, as
switching from vi insert to command mode becomes
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The following
operations act on the &lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo; keymap if no
keymap selection option was given:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="73%">


<p>Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the
selected keymap. Only keys that are unbound or bound to
<b>self-insert</b> are affected.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-r</b> <i>in-string</i>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Unbind the specified
<i>in-string</i>s in the selected keymap. This is exactly
equivalent to binding the strings to
<b>undefined-key</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">When <b>-R</b>
is also used, interpret the <i>in-string</i>s as ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">When <b>-p</b>
is also used, the <i>in-string</i>s specify prefixes. Any
binding that has the given <i>in-string</i> as a prefix, not
including the binding for the <i>in-string</i> itself, if
any, will be removed. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:36%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bindkey -rpM
viins &rsquo;&#710;[&rsquo;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">will remove all
bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an escape
character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for
the escape character itself (probably <b>vi-cmd-mode</b>).
This is incompatible with the option <b>-R</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-s</b> <i>in-string
out-string</i> ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Bind each <i>in-string</i> to
each <i>out-string</i>. When <i>in-string</i> is typed,
<i>out-string</i> will be pushed back and treated as input
to the line editor. When <b>-R</b> is also used, interpret
the <i>in-string</i>s as ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Note that both
<i>in-string</i> and <i>out-string</i> are subject to the
same form of interpretation, as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><i>in-string command</i>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Bind each <i>in-string</i> to
each <i>command</i>. When <b>-R</b> is used, interpret the
<i>in-string</i>s as ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">[ <i>in-string</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">List key bindings. If an
<i>in-string</i> is specified, the binding of that string in
the selected keymap is displayed. Otherwise, all key
bindings in the selected keymap are displayed. (As a special
case, if the <b>-e</b> or <b>-v</b> option is used alone,
the keymap is <i>not</i> displayed - the implicit linking of
keymaps is the only thing that happens.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">When the option
<b>-p</b> is used, the <i>in-string</i> must be present. The
listing shows all bindings which have the given key sequence
as a prefix, not including any bindings for the key sequence
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>-L</b> option is used, the list is in the form of
<b>bindkey</b> commands to create the key bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>-R</b> option is used as noted above, a valid range
consists of two characters, with an optional
&lsquo;<b>-</b>&rsquo; between them. All characters between
the two specified, inclusive, are bound as specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For either
<i>in-string</i> or <i>out-string</i>, the following escape
sequences are recognised:</p>

<i>name</i> is loaded into the edit buffer, and the line
editor is invoked. When the editor exits, <i>name</i> is set
to the string value returned by the editor. When the
<b>-c</b> flag is given, the parameter is created if it
doesn&rsquo;t already exist. The <b>-a</b> flag may be given
with <b>-c</b> to create an array parameter, or the
<b>-A</b> flag to create an associative array. If the type
of an existing parameter does not match the type to be
created, the parameter is unset and recreated. The <b>-g</b>
flag may be given to suppress warnings from the
<b>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</b> and <b>WARN_NESTED_VAR</b>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If an array or
array slice is being edited, separator characters as defined
in <b>$IFS</b> will be shown quoted with a backslash, as
will backslashes themselves. Conversely, when the edited

immediately following separator character or backslash; no
other special handling of backslashes, or any handling of
quotes, is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Individual
elements of existing array or associative array parameters
may be edited by using subscript syntax on <i>name</i>. New
elements are created automatically, even without
<b>-c</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>-p</b> flag is given, the following string will be taken
as the prompt to display at the left. If the <b>-r</b> flag
is given, the following string gives the prompt to display
at the right. If the <b>-h</b> flag is specified, the
history can be accessed from ZLE. If the <b>-e</b> flag is

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-M</b>
option gives a keymap to link to the <b>main</b> keymap
during editing, and the <b>-m</b> option gives a keymap to
link to the <b>vicmd</b> keymap during editing. For vi-style
editing, this allows a pair of keymaps to override
<b>viins</b> and <b>vicmd</b>. For emacs-style editing, only
<b>-M</b> is normally needed but the <b>-m</b> option may
still be used. On exit, the previous keymaps will be
restored.</p>

calls the usual &lsquo;<b>zle-line-init</b>&rsquo; and

a number of different actions concerning ZLE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">With no options
and no arguments, only the return status will be set. It is
zero if ZLE is currently active and widgets could be invoked
using this builtin command and non-zero otherwise. Note that
even if non-zero status is returned, zle may still be active
as part of the completion system; this does not allow direct
calls to ZLE widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise,

<p style="margin-left:27%;">List all existing user-defined

of <b>zle</b> commands to create the widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">When combined
with the <b>-a</b> option, all widget names are listed,
including the builtin ones. In this case the <b>-L</b>
option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If at least one
<i>string</i> is given, and <b>-a</b> is present or
<b>-L</b> is not used, nothing will be printed. The return
status will be zero if all <i>string</i>s are names of
existing widgets and non-zero if at least one <i>string</i>
is not a name of a defined widget. If <b>-a</b> is also
present, all widget names are used for the comparison
including builtin widgets, else only user-defined widgets
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If at least one

user-defined widgets matching any <i>string</i> are listed
in the form of <b>zle</b> commands to create the
widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-D</b> <i>widget</i> ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Delete the named
<i>widget</i>s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-A</b> <i>old-widget
new-widget</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Make the <i>new-widget</i> name
an alias for <i>old-widget</i>, so that both names refer to
the same widget. The names have equal standing; if either is
deleted, the other remains. If there is already a widget
with the <i>new-widget</i> name, it is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-N</b> <i>widget</i> [
<i>function</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Create a user-defined widget.
If there is already a widget with the specified name, it is
overwritten. When the new widget is invoked from within the
editor, the specified shell <i>function</i> is called. If no
function name is specified, it defaults to the same name as
the widget. For further information, see the section
&lsquo;Widgets&rsquo; below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-f</b> <i>flag</i> [
<i>flag</i>... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Set various flags on the
running widget. Possible values for <i>flag</i> are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>yank</b> for
indicating that the widget has yanked text into the buffer.
If the widget is wrapping an existing internal widget, no
further action is necessary, but if it has inserted the text
manually, then it should also take care to set
<b>YANK_START</b> and <b>YANK_END</b> correctly.
<b>yankbefore</b> does the same but is used when the yanked
text appears after the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>kill</b> for
indicating that text has been killed into the cutbuffer.
When repeatedly invoking a kill widget, text is appended to
the cutbuffer instead of replacing it, but when wrapping
such widgets, it is necessary to call &lsquo;<b>zle -f
kill</b>&rsquo; to retain this effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vichange</b>
for indicating that the widget represents a vi change that
can be repeated as a whole with
&lsquo;<b>vi-repeat-change</b>&rsquo;. The flag should be
set early in the function before inspecting the value of
<b>NUMERIC</b> or invoking other widgets. This has no effect
for a widget invoked from insert mode. If insert mode is
active when the widget finishes, the change extends until
next returning to command mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-C</b> <i>widget
completion-widget function</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Create a user-defined
completion widget named <i>widget</i>. The completion widget
will behave like the built-in completion-widget whose name
is given as <i>completion-widget</i>. To generate the
completions, the shell function <i>function</i> will be
called. For further information, see
<i>zshcompwid</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-R</b> [ <b>-c</b> ] [
<i>display-string</i> ] [ <i>string</i> ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Redisplay the command line. If
a <i>display-string</i> is given and not empty, this is
shown in the status line (immediately below the line being
edited).</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If the optional
<i>string</i>s are given they are listed below the prompt in
the same way as completion lists are printed. If no
<i>string</i>s are given but the <b>-c</b> option is used
such a list is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
immediately after returning from running widgets, the
command line will be redisplayed and the strings displayed
will be erased. Therefore, this option is only useful for
widgets that do not exit immediately after using it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">This command
can safely be called outside user defined widgets; if zle is
active, the display will be refreshed, while if zle is not
active, the command has no effect. In this case there will
usually be no other arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">The status is
zero if zle was active, else one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-M</b> <i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">As with the <b>-R</b> option,
the <i>string</i> will be displayed below the command line;
unlike the <b>-R</b> option, the string will not be put into
the status line but will instead be printed normally below
the prompt. This means that the <i>string</i> will still be
displayed after the widget returns (until it is overwritten
by subsequent commands).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-U</b> <i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">This pushes the characters in
the <i>string</i> onto the input stack of ZLE. After the
widget currently executed finishes ZLE will behave as if the
characters in the <i>string</i> were typed by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">As ZLE uses a
stack, if this option is used repeatedly the last string
pushed onto the stack will be processed first. However, the
characters in each <i>string</i> will be processed in the
order in which they appear in the string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-K</b> <i>keymap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Selects the keymap named
<i>keymap</i>. An error message will be displayed if there
is no such keymap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">This keymap
selection affects the interpretation of following keystrokes
within this invocation of ZLE. Any following invocation
(e.g., the next command line) will start as usual with the
&lsquo;<b>main</b>&rsquo; keymap selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>-F</b> [ <b>-L</b> |
<b>-w</b> ] [ <i>fd</i> [ <i>handler</i> ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Only available if your system
supports one of the &lsquo;poll&rsquo; or
&lsquo;select&rsquo; system calls; most modern systems
do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Installs
<i>handler</i> (the name of a shell function) to handle
input from file descriptor <i>fd</i>. Installing a handler
for an <i>fd</i> which is already handled causes the
existing handler to be replaced. Any number of handlers for
any number of readable file descriptors may be installed.
Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this
<i>fd</i> is actually readable when installing the handler.
The user must make their own arrangements for handling the
file descriptor when zle is not active.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">When zle is
attempting to read data, it will examine both the terminal
and the list of handled <i>fd</i>&rsquo;s. If data becomes
available on a handled <i>fd</i>, zle calls <i>handler</i>
with the fd which is ready for reading as the first
argument. Under normal circumstances this is the only
argument, but if an error was detected, a second argument
provides details: &lsquo;<b>hup</b>&rsquo; for a disconnect,
&lsquo;<b>nval</b>&rsquo; for a closed or otherwise invalid
descriptor, or &lsquo;<b>err</b>&rsquo; for any other
condition. Systems that support only the
&lsquo;select&rsquo; system call always use
&lsquo;<b>err</b>&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
<b>-w</b> is also given, the <i>handler</i> is instead a
line editor widget, typically a shell function made into a
widget using &lsquo;<b>zle -N</b>&rsquo;. In that case
<i>handler</i> can use all the facilities of zle to update
the current editing line. Note, however, that as handling
<i>fd</i> takes place at a low level changes to the display
will not automatically appear; the widget should call
&lsquo;<b>zle -R</b>&rsquo; to force redisplay. As of this
writing, widget handlers only support a single argument and
thus are never passed a string for error state, so widgets
must be prepared to test the descriptor themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If either type
of handler produces output to the terminal, it should call
&lsquo;<b>zle -I</b>&rsquo; before doing so (see below).
Handlers should not attempt to read from the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<i>handler</i> is given, but an <i>fd</i> is present, any
handler for that <i>fd</i> is removed. If there is none, an
error message is printed and status 1 is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If no arguments
are given, or the <b>-L</b> option is supplied, a list of
handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">An <i>fd</i>
(but not a <i>handler</i>) may optionally be given with the
<b>-L</b> option; in this case, the function will list the
handler if any, else silently return status 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
feature should be used with care. Activity on one of the
<i>fd</i>&rsquo;s which is not properly handled can cause
the terminal to become unusable. Removing an <i>fd</i>
handler from within a signal trap may cause unpredictable
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a
simple example of using this feature. A connection to a
remote TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see the
description of the <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> module in
<i>zshmodules</i>(1). Then a handler is installed which
simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection.
Note that &lsquo;select&rsquo; will indicate that the file
descriptor needs handling if the remote side has closed the
connection; we handle that by testing for a failed read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36%; margin-top: 1em"><b>if ztcp
pwspc 2811; then <br>
tcpfd=$REPLY <br>
handler() { <br>
zle -I <br>

if ! read -r line &lt;&amp;$1; then <br>
# select marks this fd if we reach EOF, <br>
# so handle this specially. <br>
print &quot;[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]&quot;
&gt;&amp;2 <br>
zle -F $1 <br>
return 1 <br>
fi <br>
print -r - $line <br>
} <br>
zle -F $tcpfd handler <br>

<p>Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary
widget functions, though it may be used within if normal
output to the terminal is required. It invalidates the
current zle display in preparation for output; typically
this will be from a trap function. It has no effect if zle
is not active. When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if
the display needs restoring, hence the following will print
output in such a way as not to disturb the line being
edited:</p> </td></tr>

[[ -o zle ]] &amp;&amp; zle -I <br>
# Show output <br>
print Hello <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">In general, the
trap function may need to test whether zle is active before
using this method (as shown in the example), since the
<b>zsh/zle</b> module may not even be loaded; if it is not,
the command can be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to call &lsquo;<b>zle -I</b>&rsquo; several times before
control is returned to the editor; the display will only be
invalidated the first time to minimise disruption.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
are normally better ways of manipulating the display from
within zle widgets; see, for example, &lsquo;<b>zle
-R</b>&rsquo; above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">The returned
status is zero if zle was invalidated, even though this may
have been by a previous call to &lsquo;<b>zle -I</b>&rsquo;
or by a system notification. To test if a zle widget may be
called at this point, execute <b>zle</b> with no arguments
and examine the return status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;<b>zle

currently in operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Currently the
only transformation is <b>tc</b>. This is used instead of
outputting termcap codes to the terminal. When the
transformation is in operation the shell function is passed
the termcap code that would be output as its first argument;
if the operation required a numeric argument, that is passed
as a second argument. The function should set the shell
variable <b>REPLY</b> to the transformed termcap code.
Typically this is used to produce some simply formatted
version of the code and optional argument for debugging or
testing. Note that this transformation is not applied to
other non-printing characters such as carriage returns and
newlines.</p>

<b>-K</b> <i>keymap</i> ] <i>args</i> ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%;">Invoke the specified
<i>widget</i>. This can only be done when ZLE is active;
normally this will be within a user-defined widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">With the
options <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b>, the current numeric
argument will be saved and then restored after the call to
<i>widget</i>; &lsquo;<b>-n</b> <i>num</i>&rsquo; sets the
numeric argument temporarily to <i>num</i>, while
&lsquo;<b>-N</b>&rsquo; sets it to the default, i.e. as if
there were none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">With the option
<b>-K</b>, <i>keymap</i> will be used as the current keymap
during the execution of the widget. The previous keymap will
be restored when the widget exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
calling a widget in this way does not set the special
parameter <b>WIDGET</b> and related parameters, so that the
environment appears as if the top-level widget called by the
user were still active. With the option <b>-w</b>,
<b>WIDGET</b> and related parameters are set to reflect the
widget being executed by the <b>zle</b> call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, when
<i>widget</i> returns the special parameter
<b>LASTWIDGET</b> will point to it. This can be inhibited by
passing the option <b>-f nolast</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Any further
arguments will be passed to the widget; note that as
standard argument handling is performed, any general
argument list should be preceded by <b>--</b>. If it is a
shell function, these are passed down as positional
parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in
question what it does with them. Currently arguments are
only handled by the incremental-search commands, the
<b>history-search-forward</b> and <b>-backward</b> and the
corresponding functions prefixed by <b>vi-</b>, and by
<b>universal-argument</b>. No error is flagged if the
command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">The return
status reflects the success or failure of the operation
carried out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget
the return status of the shell function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">A non-zero
return status causes the shell to beep when the widget
exits, unless the <b>BEEP</b> options was unset or the
widget was called via the <b>zle</b> command. Thus if a user
defined widget requires an immediate beep, it should call
the <b>beep</b> widget directly.</p>

<h2>ZLE WIDGETS
<a name="ZLE WIDGETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All actions in
the editor are performed by &lsquo;widgets&rsquo;. A
widget&rsquo;s job is simply to perform some small action.
The ZLE commands that key sequences in keymaps are bound to
are in fact widgets. Widgets can be user-defined or built
in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
widgets built into ZLE are listed in the section
&lsquo;Standard Widgets&rsquo; below. Other built-in widgets
can be defined by other modules (see <i>zshmodules</i>(1)).
Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical
name, and the same name preceded by a
&lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo; name is
special: it can&rsquo;t be rebound to a different widget.
This makes the widget available even when its usual name has
been redefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">User-defined
widgets are defined using &lsquo;<b>zle -N</b>&rsquo;, and
implemented as shell functions. When the widget is executed,
the corresponding shell function is executed, and can
perform editing (or other) actions. It is recommended that
user-defined widgets should not have names starting with
&lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>USER-DEFINED WIDGETS
<a name="USER-DEFINED WIDGETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">User-defined
widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can execute
any normal shell command. They can also run other widgets
(whether built-in or user-defined) using the <b>zle</b>
builtin command. The standard input of the function is
redirected from /dev/null to prevent external commands from
unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal,
but <b>read -k</b> or <b>read -q</b> can be used to read
characters. Finally, they can examine and edit the ZLE
buffer being edited by reading and setting the special
parameters described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These special
parameters are always available in widget functions, but are
not in any way special outside ZLE. If they have some normal
value outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible,
but will return when the widget function exits. These
special parameters in fact have local scope, like parameters
created in a function using <b>local</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Inside
completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active,
these parameters are available read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
parameters appear as local to any ZLE widget in which they
appear. Hence if it is desired to override them this needs
to be done within a nested function:</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>widget-function()
{ <br>
# $WIDGET here refers to the special variable <br>
# that is local inside widget-function <br>
() { <br>
# This anonymous nested function allows WIDGET <br>
# to be used as a local variable. The -h <br>
# removes the special status of the variable. <br>
local -h WIDGET <br>
} <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>BUFFER</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The entire contents of the edit
buffer. If it is written to, the cursor remains at the same
offset, unless that would put it outside the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>BUFFERLINES</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of screen lines
needed for the edit buffer currently displayed on screen
(i.e. without any changes to the preceding parameters done
after the last redisplay); read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CONTEXT</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The context in which zle was
called to read a line; read-only. One of the values:</p>

<td width="10%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CURSOR</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The offset of the cursor,
within the edit buffer. This is in the range 0 to
<b>$#BUFFER</b>, and is by definition equal to
<b>$#LBUFFER</b>. Attempts to move the cursor outside the
buffer will result in the cursor being moved to the
appropriate end of the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>CUTBUFFER</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The last item cut using one of
the &lsquo;<b>kill-</b>&rsquo; commands; the string which
the next yank would insert in the line. Later entries in the
kill ring are in the array <b>killring</b>. Note that the
command &lsquo;<b>zle copy-region-as-kill</b>
<i>string</i>&rsquo; can be used to set the text of the cut
buffer from a shell function and cycle the kill ring in the
same way as interactively killing text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>HISTNO</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The current history number.
Setting this has the same effect as moving up or down in the
history to the corresponding history line. An attempt to set
it is ignored if the line is not stored in the history. Note
this is not the same as the parameter <b>HISTCMD</b>, which
always gives the number of the history line being added to
the main shell&rsquo;s history. <b>HISTNO</b> refers to the
line being retrieved within zle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ISEARCHMATCH_ACTIVE</b>
(integer) <b><br>
ISEARCHMATCH_START</b> (integer) <b><br>
ISEARCHMATCH_END</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>ISEARCHMATCH_ACTIVE</b>
indicates whether a part of the <b>BUFFER</b> is currently
matched by an incremental search pattern.
<b>ISEARCHMATCH_START</b> and <b>ISEARCHMATCH_END</b> give
the location of the matched part and are in the same units
as <b>CURSOR</b>. They are only valid for reading when
<b>ISEARCHMATCH_ACTIVE</b> is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">All parameters
are read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>KEYMAP</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The name of the currently
selected keymap; read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>KEYS</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The keys typed to invoke this
widget, as a literal string; read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>KEYS_QUEUED_COUNT</b>
(integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of bytes pushed back
to the input queue and therefore available for reading
immediately before any I/O is done; read-only. See also
<b>PENDING</b>; the two values are distinct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>killring</b> (array)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The array of previously killed
items, with the most recently killed first. This gives the
items that would be retrieved by a <b>yank-pop</b> in the
same order. Note, however, that the most recently killed
item is in <b>$CUTBUFFER</b>; <b>$killring</b> shows the
array of previous entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The default
size for the kill ring is eight, however the length may be
changed by normal array operations. Any empty string in the
kill ring is ignored by the <b>yank-pop</b> command, hence
the size of the array effectively sets the maximum length of
the kill ring, while the number of non-zero strings gives
the current length, both as seen by the user at the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LASTABORTEDSEARCH</b>
(scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The last search string used by
an interactive search that was aborted by the user (status 3
returned by the search widget).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LASTSEARCH</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The last search string used by
an interactive search; read-only. This is set even if the
search failed (status 0, 1 or 2 returned by the search
widget), but not if it was aborted by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LASTWIDGET</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The name of the last widget
that was executed; read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>LBUFFER</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The part of the buffer that
lies to the left of the cursor position. If it is assigned
to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the cursor
remains between the new <b>$LBUFFER</b> and the old
<b>$RBUFFER</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>MARK</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Like <b>CURSOR</b>, but for the
mark. With vi-mode operators that wait for a movement
command to select a region of text, setting <b>MARK</b>
allows the selection to extend in both directions from the
initial cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>NUMERIC</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The numeric argument. If no
numeric argument was given, this parameter is unset. When
this is set inside a widget function, builtin widgets called
with the <b>zle</b> builtin command will use the value
assigned. If it is unset inside a widget function, builtin
widgets called behave as if no numeric argument was
given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PENDING</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of bytes pending for
input, i.e. the number of bytes which have already been
typed and can immediately be read. On systems where the
shell is not able to get this information, this parameter
will always have a value of zero. Read-only. See also
<b>KEYS_QUEUED_COUNT</b>; the two values are distinct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PREBUFFER</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">In a multi-line input at the
secondary prompt, this read-only parameter contains the
contents of the lines before the one the cursor is currently
in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>PREDISPLAY</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Text to be displayed before the
start of the editable text buffer. This does not have to be
a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline must
be appended explicitly. The text is reset on each new
invocation (but not recursive invocation) of zle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>POSTDISPLAY</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Text to be displayed after the
end of the editable text buffer. This does not have to be a
complete line; to display a complete line, a newline must be
prepended explicitly. The text is reset on each new
invocation (but not recursive invocation) of zle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>RBUFFER</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The part of the buffer that
lies to the right of the cursor position. If it is assigned
to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the cursor
remains between the old <b>$LBUFFER</b> and the new
<b>$RBUFFER</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>REGION_ACTIVE</b>
(integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates if the region is
currently active. It can be assigned 0 or 1 to deactivate
and activate the region respectively. A value of 2 activates
the region in line-wise mode with the highlighted text
extending for whole lines only; see <i>Character
Highlighting</i> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>region_highlight</b>
(array)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Each element of this array may
be set to a string that describes highlighting for an
arbitrary region of the command line that will take effect
the next time the command line is redisplayed. Highlighting
of the non-editable parts of the command line in
<b>PREDISPLAY</b> and <b>POSTDISPLAY</b> are possible, but
note that the <b>P</b> flag is needed for character indexing
to include <b>PREDISPLAY</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Each string
consists of the following whitespace-separated parts:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p>Optionally, a &lsquo;<b>P</b>&rsquo; to signify that the
start and end offset that follow include any string set by
the <b>PREDISPLAY</b> special parameter; this is needed if
the predisplay string itself is to be highlighted.

<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="73%">


<p>Optionally, a string of the form
&lsquo;<b>memo=</b><i>token</i>&rsquo;. The <i>token</i>
consists of everything between the &lsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo;
and the next whitespace, comma, NUL, or the end of the
string. The <i>token</i> is preserved verbatim but not
parsed in any way.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Plugins may use
this to identify array elements they have added: for
example, a plugin might set <i>token</i> to its (the
plugin&rsquo;s) name and then use
&lsquo;<b>region_highlight=(
${region_highlight:#*memo=</b><i>token</i><b>} )</b>&rsquo;
in order to remove array elements it have added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">(This example
uses the
&lsquo;<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:#</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b>&rsquo;
array-grepping syntax described in the section
&lsquo;Parameter Expansion&rsquo; in <i>zshexpn</i>(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For

the first twenty characters of the text including any
predisplay string should be highlighted in bold.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
effect of <b>region_highlight</b> is not saved and
disappears as soon as the line is accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that zsh

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The final
highlighting on the command line depends on both
<b>region_highlight</b> and <b>zle_highlight</b>; see the
section CHARACTER HIGHLIGHTING below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>registers</b> (associative
array)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The contents of each of the vi
register buffers. These are typically set using
<b>vi-set-buffer</b> followed by a delete, change or yank
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>SUFFIX_ACTIVE</b> (integer)
<b><br>
SUFFIX_START</b> (integer) <b><br>
SUFFIX_END</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>SUFFIX_ACTIVE</b> indicates
whether an auto-removable completion suffix is currently
active. <b>SUFFIX_START</b> and <b>SUFFIX_END</b> give the
location of the suffix and are in the same units as
<b>CURSOR</b>. They are only valid for reading when
<b>SUFFIX_ACTIVE</b> is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">All parameters
are read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>UNDO_CHANGE_NO</b>
(integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A number representing the state
of the undo history. The only use of this is passing as an
argument to the <b>undo</b> widget in order to undo back to
the recorded point. Read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>UNDO_LIMIT_NO</b>
(integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A number corresponding to an
existing change in the undo history; compare
<b>UNDO_CHANGE_NO</b>. If this is set to a value greater
than zero, the <b>undo</b> command will not allow the line
to be undone beyond the given change number. It is still
possible to use &lsquo;<b>zle undo</b> <i>change</i>&rsquo;
in a widget to undo beyond that point; in that case, it will
not be possible to undo at all until <b>UNDO_LIMIT_NO</b> is
reduced. Set to 0 to disable the limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A typical use
of this variable in a widget function is as follows (note
the additional function scope is required):</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>() { <br>
local UNDO_LIMIT_NO=$UNDO_CHANGE_NO <br>
# Perform some form of recursive edit. <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>WIDGET</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The name of the widget
currently being executed; read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>WIDGETFUNC</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The name of the shell function
that implements a widget defined with either <b>zle -N</b>
or <b>zle -C</b>. In the former case, this is the second
argument to the <b>zle -N</b> command that defined the
widget, or the first argument if there was no second
argument. In the latter case this is the third argument to
the <b>zle -C</b> command that defined the widget.
Read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>WIDGETSTYLE</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Describes the implementation
behind the completion widget currently being executed; the
second argument that followed <b>zle -C</b> when the widget
was defined. This is the name of a builtin completion
widget. For widgets defined with <b>zle -N</b> this is set
to the empty string. Read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>YANK_ACTIVE</b> (integer)
<b><br>
YANK_START</b> (integer) <b><br>
YANK_END</b> (integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>YANK_ACTIVE</b> indicates
whether text has just been yanked (pasted) into the buffer.
<b>YANK_START</b> and <b>YANK_END</b> give the location of
the pasted text and are in the same units as <b>CURSOR</b>.
They are only valid for reading when <b>YANK_ACTIVE</b> is
non-zero. They can also be assigned by widgets that insert
text in a yank-like fashion, for example wrappers of
<b>bracketed-paste</b>. See also <b>zle -f</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>YANK_ACTIVE</b>
is read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ZLE_RECURSIVE</b>
(integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Usually zero, but incremented
inside any instance of <b>recursive-edit</b>. Hence
indicates the current recursion level.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ZLE_RECURSIVE</b>
is read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ZLE_STATE</b> (scalar)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Contains a set of
space-separated words that describe the current <b>zle</b>
state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, the
states shown are the insert mode as set by the
<b>overwrite-mode</b> or <b>vi-replace</b> widgets and
whether history commands will visit imported entries as
controlled by the set-local-history widget. The string
contains &lsquo;<b>insert</b>&rsquo; if characters to be
inserted on the command line move existing characters to the
right or &lsquo;<b>overwrite</b>&rsquo; if characters to be
inserted overwrite existing characters. It contains
&lsquo;<b>localhistory</b>&rsquo; if only local history
commands will be visited or
&lsquo;<b>globalhistory</b>&rsquo; if imported history
commands will also be visited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The substrings
are sorted in alphabetical order so that if you want to test
for two specific substrings in a future-proof way, you can

<h3>Special Widgets
<a name="Special Widgets"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are a few
user-defined widgets which are special to the shell. If they
do not exist, no special action is taken. The environment
provided is identical to that for any other editing widget.
<b><br>
zle-isearch-exit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Executed at the end of
incremental search at the point where the isearch prompt is
removed from the display. See <b>zle-isearch-update</b> for
an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>zle-isearch-update</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Executed within incremental
search when the display is about to be redrawn. Additional
output below the incremental search prompt can be generated
by using &lsquo;<b>zle -M</b>&rsquo; within the widget. For
example,</p>


<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle-isearch-update()
{ zle -M &quot;Line $HISTNO&quot;; } <br>
zle -N zle-isearch-update</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note the line
output by &lsquo;<b>zle -M</b>&rsquo; is not deleted on exit
from incremental search. This can be done from a
<b>zle-isearch-exit</b> widget:</p>


<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle-isearch-exit()
{ zle -M &quot;&quot;; } <br>
zle -N zle-isearch-exit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>zle-line-pre-redraw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Executed whenever the input
line is about to be redrawn, providing an opportunity to
update the region_highlight array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>zle-line-init</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Executed every time the line
editor is started to read a new line of input. The following
example puts the line editor into vi command mode when it
starts up.</p>


<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle-line-init()
{ zle -K vicmd; } <br>
zle -N zle-line-init</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">(The command
inside the function sets the keymap directly; it is
equivalent to <b>zle vi-cmd-mode</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>zle-line-finish</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This is similar to
<b>zle-line-init</b> but is executed every time the line
editor has finished reading a line of input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>zle-history-line-set</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Executed when the history line
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>zle-keymap-select</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Executed every time the keymap
changes, i.e. the special parameter <b>KEYMAP</b> is set to
a different value, while the line editor is active.
Initialising the keymap when the line editor starts does not
cause the widget to be called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The value
<b>$KEYMAP</b> within the function reflects the new keymap.
The old keymap is passed as the sole argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
used for detecting switches between the vi command
(<b>vicmd</b>) and insert (usually <b>main</b>) keymaps.</p>

<h2>STANDARD WIDGETS
<a name="STANDARD WIDGETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following is
a list of all the standard widgets, and their default
bindings in emacs mode, vi command mode and vi insert mode
(the &lsquo;<b>emacs</b>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<b>vicmd</b>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<b>viins</b>&rsquo; keymaps, respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that cursor
keys are bound to movement keys in all three keymaps; the
shell assumes that the cursor keys send the key sequences
reported by the terminal-handling library (termcap or
terminfo). The key sequences shown in the list are those
based on the VT100, common on many modern terminals, but in
fact these are not necessarily bound. In the case of the
<b>viins</b> keymap, the initial escape character of the
sequences serves also to return to the <b>vicmd</b> keymap:
whether this happens is determined by the <b>KEYTIMEOUT</b>
parameter, see <i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>

same effect. Note that the following always perform the same
task within incremental searches and cannot be replaced by
user defined widgets, nor can the set of functions be
extended. The supported functions are: <b><br>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When called
from a widget function by the <b>zle</b> command, the
incremental search commands can take a string argument. This
will be treated as a string of keys, as for arguments to the
<b>bindkey</b> command, and used as initial input for the

the incremental search will be silently ignored. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>history-incremental-pattern-search-backward
<br>
history-incremental-pattern-search-forward</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">These widgets behave similarly
to the corresponding widgets with no <b>-pattern</b>, but
the search string typed by the user is treated as a pattern,
respecting the current settings of the various options
affecting pattern matching. See FILENAME GENERATION in
<i>zshexpn</i>(1) for a description of patterns. If no
numeric argument was given lowercase letters in the search
string may match uppercase letters in the history. The
string may begin with &lsquo;<b>&#710;</b>&rsquo; to anchor
the search to the beginning of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The prompt
changes to indicate an invalid pattern; this may simply
indicate the pattern is not yet complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that only
non-overlapping matches are reported, so an expression with
wildcards may return fewer matches on a line than are
visible by inspection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>vi-history-search-backward</b>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Search backward in the history

beginning of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A restricted
set of editing functions is available in the mini-buffer. An

bindings of the current insert mode will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If called from

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>vi-history-search-forward</b>
(unbound) (<b>?</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Search forward in the history
for a specified string. The string may begin with
&lsquo;<b>&#710;</b>&rsquo; to anchor the search to the
beginning of the line. The functions available in the
mini-buffer are the same as for
<b>vi-history-search-backward</b>. Argument handling is also
the same as for that command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>infer-next-history</b>

following it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>insert-last-word</b>
(<b>ESC-_ ESC-.</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Insert the last word from the
previous history event at the cursor position. If a positive
numeric argument is given, insert that word from the end of
the previous history event. If the argument is zero or
negative insert that word from the left (zero inserts the
previous command word). Repeating this command replaces the
word just inserted with the last word from the history event
prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in
the same way to pick a word from that event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When called
from a shell function invoked from a user-defined widget,
the command can take one to three arguments. The first
argument specifies a history offset which applies to
successive calls to this widget: if it is -1, the default
behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive calls will
move forwards through the history. The value 0 can be used
to indicate that the history line examined by the previous
execution of the command will be reexamined. Note that
negative numbers should be preceded by a
&lsquo;<b>--</b>&rsquo; argument to avoid confusing them
with options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If two
arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the
command line in normal array index notation (as a more
natural alternative to the numeric argument). Hence 1 is the
first word, and -1 (the default) is the last word.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If a third
argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used to
signify that the history offset is relative to the current
history line, rather than the one remembered after the
previous invocations of <b>insert-last-word</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the default behaviour of the command corresponds to</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle
insert-last-word -- -1 -1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">while the

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle
insert-last-word -- -1 1 -</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">always copies
the first word of the line in the history immediately before
the line being edited. This has the side effect that later
invocations of the widget will be relative to that line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Repeat the last vi history

</h3>



<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>digit-argument</b>
(<b>ESC-0</b>..<b>ESC-9</b>) (<b>1</b>-<b>9</b>)
(unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Start a new numeric argument,
or add to the current one. See also
<b>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</b>. This only works if
bound to a key sequence ending in a decimal digit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Inside a widget
function, a call to this function treats the last key of the
key sequence which called the widget as the digit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>neg-argument</b>
(<b>ESC--</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Changes the sign of the
following argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>universal-argument</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Multiply the argument of the
next command by 4. Alternatively, if this command is
followed by an integer (positive or negative), use that as
the argument for the next command. Thus digits cannot be
repeated using this command. For example, if this command
occurs twice, followed immediately by <b>forward-char</b>,
move forward sixteen spaces; if instead it is followed by
<b>-2</b>, then <b>forward-char</b>, move backward two
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Inside a widget
function, if passed an argument, i.e. &lsquo;<b>zle
universal-argument</b> <i>num</i>&rsquo;, the numeric
argument will be set to <i>num</i>; this is equivalent to
&lsquo;<b>NUMERIC=</b><i>num</i>&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>argument-base</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the existing numeric
argument as a numeric base, which must be in the range 2 to
36 inclusive. Subsequent use of <b>digit-argument</b> and
<b>universal-argument</b> will input a new numeric argument
in the given base. The usual hexadecimal convention is used:
the letter <b>a</b> or <b>A</b> corresponds to 10, and so
on. Arguments in bases requiring digits from 10 upwards are
more conveniently input with <b>universal-argument</b>,
since <b>ESC-a</b> etc. are not usually bound to
<b>digit-argument</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The function
can be used with a command argument inside a user-defined
widget. The following code sets the base to 16 and lets the
user input a hexadecimal argument until a key out of the
digit range is typed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle

starts up, the buffer will be popped off the top of the
buffer stack and loaded into the editing buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>push-line-or-edit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">At the top-level (<b>PS1</b>)
prompt, equivalent to <b>push-line</b>. At a secondary
(<b>PS2</b>) prompt, move the entire current multiline
construct into the editor buffer. The latter is equivalent
to <b>push-input</b> followed by <b>get-line</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>read-command</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Only useful from a user-defined
widget. A keystroke is read just as in normal operation, but
instead of the command being executed the name of the
command that would be executed is stored in the shell
parameter <b>REPLY</b>. This can be used as the argument of
a future <b>zle</b> command. If the key sequence is not
bound, status 1 is returned; typically, however,
<b>REPLY</b> is set to <b>undefined-key</b> to indicate a
useless key sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>recursive-edit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Only useful from a user-defined
widget. At this point in the function, the editor regains
control until one of the standard widgets which would
normally cause zle to exit (typically an <b>accept-line</b>
caused by hitting the return key) is executed. Instead,
control returns to the user-defined widget. The status
returned is non-zero if the return was caused by an error,
but the function still continues executing and hence may
tidy up. This makes it safe for the user-defined widget to
alter the command line or key bindings temporarily.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The following
widget, <b>caps-lock</b>, serves as an example.</p>


<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>self-insert-ucase()
{ <br>
LBUFFER+=${(U)KEYS[-1]} <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>integer
stat</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle -N
self-insert self-insert-ucase <br>
zle -A caps-lock save-caps-lock <br>
zle -A accept-line caps-lock</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle -A

zle -D save-caps-lock</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(( stat ))
&amp;&amp; zle send-break</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>return
$stat</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This causes
typed letters to be inserted capitalised until either
<b>accept-line</b> (i.e. typically the return key) is typed
or the <b>caps-lock</b> widget is invoked again; the later
is handled by saving the old definition of <b>caps-lock</b>
as <b>save-caps-lock</b> and then rebinding it to invoke
<b>accept-line</b>. Note that an error from the recursive
edit is detected as a non-zero return status and propagated
by using the <b>send-break</b> widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>redisplay</b> (unbound)
(<b>&#710;R</b>) (<b>&#710;R</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Redisplays the edit buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>reset-prompt</b> (unbound)
(unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Force the prompts on both the
left and right of the screen to be re-expanded, then
redisplay the edit buffer. This reflects changes both to the
prompt variables themselves and changes in the expansion of
the values (for example, changes in time or directory, or
changes to the value of variables referred to by the
prompt).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the
prompt is only expanded each time zle starts, and when the
display has been interrupted by output from another part of
the shell (such as a job notification) which causes the
command line to be reprinted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reset-prompt</b>
doesn&rsquo;t alter the special parameter
<b>LASTWIDGET</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>send-break</b> (<b>&#710;G
ESC-&#710;G</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Abort the current editor
function, e.g. <b>execute-named-command</b>, or the editor
itself, e.g. if you are in <b>vared</b>. Otherwise abort the
parsing of the current line; in this case the aborted line
is available in the shell variable <b>ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</b>.
If the editor is aborted from within <b>vared</b>, the
variable <b>ZLE_VARED_ABORTED</b> is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>run-help</b> (<b>ESC-H
ESC-h</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Push the buffer onto the buffer
stack, and execute the command &lsquo;<b>run-help</b>
<i>cmd</i>&rsquo;, where <i>cmd</i> is the current command.
<b>run-help</b> is normally aliased to <b>man</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>vi-set-buffer</b> (unbound)
(<b>&quot;</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify a buffer to be used in
the following command. There are 37 buffers that can be
specified: the 26 &lsquo;named&rsquo; buffers <b>&quot;a</b>
to <b>&quot;z</b>, the &lsquo;yank&rsquo; buffer
<b>&quot;0</b>, the nine &lsquo;queued&rsquo; buffers
<b>&quot;1</b> to <b>&quot;9</b> and the &lsquo;black
hole&rsquo; buffer <b>&quot;_</b>. The named buffers can
also be specified as <b>&quot;A</b> to <b>&quot;Z</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When a buffer
is specified for a cut, change or yank command, the text
concerned replaces the previous contents of the specified
buffer. If a named buffer is specified using a capital, the
newly cut text is appended to the buffer instead of
overwriting it. When using the <b>&quot;_</b> buffer,
nothing happens. This can be useful for deleting text
without affecting any buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If no buffer is
specified for a cut or change command, <b>&quot;1</b> is
used, and the contents of <b>&quot;1</b> to <b>&quot;8</b>
are each shifted along one buffer; the contents of
<b>&quot;9</b> is lost. If no buffer is specified for a yank
command, <b>&quot;0</b> is used. Finally, a paste command
without a specified buffer will paste the text from the most
recent command regardless of any buffer that might have been
used with that command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When called
from a widget function by the <b>zle</b> command, the buffer
can optionally be specified with an argument. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle
vi-set-buffer A</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>vi-set-mark</b> (unbound)
(<b>m</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the specified mark at the
cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>set-mark-command</b>
(<b>&#710;@</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Set the mark at the cursor
position. If called with a negative numeric argument, do not
set the mark but deactivate the region so that it is no
longer highlighted (it is still usable for other purposes).
Otherwise the region is marked as active.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>spell-word</b> (<b>ESC-$
ESC-S ESC-s</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Attempt spelling correction on
the current word.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>split-undo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Breaks the undo sequence at the
current change. This is useful in vi mode as changes made in
insert mode are coalesced on entering command mode.
Similarly, <b>undo</b> will normally revert as one all the
changes made by a user-defined widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>undefined-key</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This command is executed when a
key sequence that is not bound to any command is typed. By
default it beeps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>undo</b> (<b>&#710;_ &#710;Xu
&#710;X&#710;U</b>) (<b>u</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Incrementally undo the last
text modification. When called from a user-defined widget,
takes an optional argument indicating a previous state of
the undo history as returned by the <b>UNDO_CHANGE_NO</b>
variable; modifications are undone until that state is
reached, subject to any limit imposed by the
<b>UNDO_LIMIT_NO</b> variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
invoked from vi command mode, the full prior change made in
insert mode is reverted, the changes having been merged when
command mode was selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>redo</b> (unbound)
(<b>&#710;R</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Incrementally redo undone text
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>vi-undo-change</b> (unbound)
(unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Undo the last text
modification. If repeated, redo the modification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>visual-mode</b> (unbound)
(<b>v</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Toggle vim-style visual
selection mode. If line-wise visual mode is currently
enabled then it is changed to being character-wise. If used
following an operator, it forces the subsequent movement
command to be treated as a character-wise movement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>visual-line-mode</b>
(unbound) (<b>V</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Toggle vim-style line-wise
visual selection mode. If character-wise visual mode is
currently enabled then it is changed to being line-wise. If
used following an operator, it forces the subsequent
movement command to be treated as a line-wise movement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>what-cursor-position</b>
(<b>&#710;X=</b>) (<b>ga</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the character under the
cursor, its code as an octal, decimal and hexadecimal
number, the current cursor position within the buffer and
the column of the cursor in the current line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>where-is</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Read the name of an editor
command and print the listing of key sequences that invoke
the specified command. A restricted set of editing functions
is available in the mini-buffer. Keys are looked up in the
special <b>command</b> keymap, and if not found there in the
main keymap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>which-command</b>
(<b>ESC-?</b>) (unbound) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Push the buffer onto the buffer
stack, and execute the command &lsquo;<b>which-command</b>
<i>cmd</i>&rsquo;. where <i>cmd</i> is the current command.
<b>which-command</b> is normally aliased to
<b>whence</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</b>
(unbound) (<b>0</b>) (unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If the last command executed
was a digit as part of an argument, continue the argument.
Otherwise, execute vi-beginning-of-line.</p>

<h3>Text Objects
<a name="Text Objects"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Text objects are
commands that can be used to select a block of text
according to some criteria. They are a feature of the vim
text editor and so are primarily intended for use with vi
operators or from visual selection mode. However, they can
also be used from vi-insert or emacs mode. Key bindings
listed below apply to the <b>viopp</b> and <b>visual</b>
keymaps. <b><br>
select-a-blank-word</b> (<b>aW</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select a word including
adjacent blanks, where a word is defined as a series of
non-blank characters. With a numeric argument, multiple
words will be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>select-a-shell-word</b>
(<b>aa</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select the current command
argument applying the normal rules for quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>select-a-word</b>
(<b>aw</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select a word including
adjacent blanks, using the normal vi-style word definition.
With a numeric argument, multiple words will be
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>select-in-blank-word</b>
(<b>iW</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select a word, where a word is
defined as a series of non-blank characters. With a numeric
argument, multiple words will be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>select-in-shell-word</b>
(<b>ia</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select the current command
argument applying the normal rules for quoting. If the
argument begins and ends with matching quote characters,
these are not included in the selection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>select-in-word</b>
(<b>iw</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Select a word, using the normal
vi-style word definition. With a numeric argument, multiple
words will be selected.</p>

<h2>CHARACTER HIGHLIGHTING
<a name="CHARACTER HIGHLIGHTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The line editor
has the ability to highlight characters or regions of the
line that have a particular significance. This is controlled
by the array parameter <b>zle_highlight</b>, if it has been
set by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the parameter
contains the single entry <b>none</b> all highlighting is
turned off. Note the parameter is still expected to be an
array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise each
entry of the array should consist of a word indicating a
context for highlighting, then a colon, then a
comma-separated list of the types of highlighting to apply
in that context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The contexts
available for highlighting are the following: <b><br>
default</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Any text within the command
line not affected by any other highlighting. Text outside
the editable area of the command line is not affected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>isearch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When one of the incremental
history search widgets is active, the area of the command
line matched by the search string or pattern.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>region</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>The currently selected text. In emacs terminology, this
is referred to as the region and is bounded by the cursor
(point) and the mark. The region is only highlighted if it
is active, which is the case after the mark is modified with
<b>set-mark-command</b> or <b>exchange-point-and-mark</b>.
Note that whether or not the region is active has no effect
on its use within emacs style widgets, it simply determines
whether it is highlighted. In vi mode, the region
corresponds to selected text in visual mode.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>special</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Individual characters that have
no direct printable representation but are shown in a
special manner by the line editor. These characters are

<p>This context is used in completion for characters that
are marked as suffixes that will be removed if the
completion ends at that point, the most obvious example
being a slash (<b>/</b>) after a directory name. Note that
suffix removal is configurable; the circumstances under
which the suffix will be removed may differ for different

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When

character is affected by multiple specifications, the last
specification wins.</p>


<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>zle_highlight</b>
may contain additional fields for controlling how terminal
sequences to change colours are output. Each of the
following is followed by a colon and a string in the same
form as for key bindings. This will not be necessary for the
vast majority of terminals as the defaults shown in
parentheses are widely used. <b><br>
fg_start_code</b> (<b>\e[3</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The start of the escape
sequence for the foreground colour. This is followed by one
to three ASCII digits representing the colour. Only used for
palette colors, i.e. not 24-bit colors specified via a color
triplet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>fg_default_code</b>
(<b>9</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number to use instead of
the colour to reset the default foreground colour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>fg_end_code</b>
(<b>m</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The end of the escape sequence
for the foreground colour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>bg_start_code</b>
(<b>\e[4</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The start of the escape
sequence for the background colour. See <b>fg_start_code</b>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>bg_default_code</b>

<td width="82%">


<p>No highlighting is applied to the given context. It is
not useful for this to appear with other types of
highlighting; it is used to override a default.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>fg=</b><i>colour</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The foreground colour should be
set to <i>colour</i>, a decimal integer, the name of one of
the eight most widely-supported colours or as a
&lsquo;<b>#</b>&rsquo; followed by an RGB triplet in
hexadecimal format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Not all
terminals support this and, of those that do, not all
provide facilities to test the support, hence the user
should decide based on the terminal type. Most terminals
support the colours <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>,
<b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b> and
<b>white</b>, which can be set by name. In addition.
<b>default</b> may be used to set the terminal&rsquo;s
default foreground colour. Abbreviations are allowed;
<b>b</b> or <b>bl</b> selects black. Some terminals may
generate additional colours if the <b>bold</b> attribute is
also present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">On recent
terminals and on systems with an up-to-date terminal
database the number of colours supported may be tested by
the command &lsquo;<b>echotc Co</b>&rsquo;; if this
succeeds, it indicates a limit on the number of colours
which will be enforced by the line editor. The number of
colours is in any case limited to 256 (i.e. the range 0 to
255).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Some modern
terminal emulators have support for 24-bit true colour (16
million colours). In this case, the hex triplet format can
be used. This consists of a &lsquo;<b>#</b>&rsquo; followed
by either a three or six digit hexadecimal number describing
the red, green and blue components of the colour. Hex
triplets can also be used with 88 and 256 colour terminals
via the <b>zsh/nearcolor</b> module (see
<i>zshmodules</i>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Colour is also
known as color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>bg=</b><i>colour</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The background colour should be
set to <i>colour</i>. This works similarly to the foreground
colour, except the background is not usually affected by the
bold attribute.</p>

<p>The characters in the given context are shown in a bold
font. Not all terminals distinguish bold fonts.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>standout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The characters in the given
context are shown in the terminal&rsquo;s standout mode. The
actual effect is specific to the terminal; on many terminals
it is inverse video. On some such terminals, where the
cursor does not blink it appears with standout mode negated,
making it less than clear where the cursor actually is. On
such terminals one of the other effects may be preferable
for highlighting the region and matched search string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>underline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The characters in the given
context are shown underlined. Some terminals show the
foreground in a different colour instead; in this case
whitespace will not be highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The characters
described above as &lsquo;special&rsquo; are as follows. The
formatting described here is used irrespective of whether
the characters are highlighted: <br>
ASCII control characters</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Control characters in the ASCII
range are shown as &lsquo;<b>&#710;</b>&rsquo; followed by
the base character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">Unprintable multibyte
characters</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This item applies to control
characters not in the ASCII range, plus other characters as
follows. If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is in effect,
multibyte characters not in the ASCII character set that are
reported as having zero width are treated as combining
characters when the option <b>COMBINING_CHARS</b> is on. If
the option is off, or if a character appears where a
combining character is not valid, the character is treated
as unprintable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Unprintable
multibyte characters are shown as a hexadecimal number
between angle brackets. The number is the code point of the
character in the wide character set; this may or may not be
Unicode, depending on the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">Invalid multibyte characters</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option
is in effect, any sequence of one or more bytes that does
not form a valid character in the current character set is
treated as a series of bytes each shown as a special
character. This case can be distinguished from other
unprintable characters as the bytes are represented as two
hexadecimal digits between angle brackets, as distinct from
the four or eight digits that are used for unprintable
characters that are nonetheless valid in the current
character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Not all systems
support this: for it to work, the system&rsquo;s
representation of wide characters must be code values from
the Universal Character Set, as defined by IS0 10646 (also
known as Unicode).</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%;">Wrapped double-width
characters</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When a double-width character
appears in the final column of a line, it is instead shown
on the next line. The empty space left in the original
position is highlighted as a special character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If
